{"text":"Given the state of research on diet, it's hard to say how much you should care about the recipe using butter vs olive oil, but either way, the quantity sounds excessive. Partly because congealed butter on top sounds unappetizing and wasteful. I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result. That said, this sounds like a holiday recipe, and it's best not to try to force holiday recipes to change.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

I mean, if you're going keto, then your options will be severely limitted to pretty much meat, cheese, berries, and non-starchy vegetables, but if you can afford 100+ g carbs per day then starchy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains become easier to include.

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

My problem is that I could never quite reproduce the taste each time I made it without using a recipe. My wife would ask me to make a dish that was really good last time, and it would turn out different. Not bad, mind you, but not the same as she was expecting. Recently, I've been delving more into good blogs and online recipes, and I have to say I'm hitting it out of the park! I still occasionally make changes to dishes that I'm more familiar with, since I'm pretty comfortable working with different flavors and cooking methods. FYI, just because you follow a recipe doesn't mean you're not a good cook. You still have to understand and do things right. On the flip side, I've known many people (my mom in particular; don't tell her I said so) who could follow the exact same recipe and end up with something really bad. Some things that I've been making and getting rave reviews lately on are nearly foolproof however, especially using a slow cooker.

Indian restaurant food isn't that far behind. The biggest barrier, by a very very wide margin, is the common misconception that one of these seemingly countless recipes out there actually hits the mark. It's apathy that's holding us back.

Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice.

A friend of my wife's was staying with her mom at that point, and they had a couple extra bedrooms so they invited us to stay instead of trying to find a hotel. To repay the kindness, I offered to cook a nice dinner, figuring that they haven't had someone cook for them in quite a while and wanting to repay them for hosting us. Finding dishes and utensils wasn't so bad. However, I pulled out a hot dish of chicken parm from the oven, and unfortunately I picked an oven mitt that didn't have adequate protection. And the oven was more than a few steps from the table. And all the countertops were cold granite, no trivets in sight. The only way to not launch the hot af dish, or put it on a cold granite counter (likely shattering the dish and ruining the chicken due to thermal shock) was to grab it with my other bare hand. That burn sucked ass, because the reason I was in town was a music festival and I was there to perform. Fortunately most of the work on my instrument was with my right hand, and the burn was on my left. But it still sucked ass.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

OP says he likes cooking, that's not enough, one has to love cooking, and OP won't know if he/she does untill they do it for real.

Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Pur\u00e9e and strain. Add tamarind paste and dark chocolate and cumin and cinnamon for a basic mole Grill tomatillos, peel, pur\u00e9e with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice and garlic for a salsa verde. Grill Anaheim or hatch chiles, peel and chop with garlic for a New Mexico style green chili Add fish sauce to any of the above chili sauces for a Thai inspired chili sauce Equal parts fish sauce and brown sugar, water for a Vietnamese dipping sauce Fish sauce, peanut butter and soy sauce for a peanut sauce Fish sauce, brown sugar water and onions will reduce and make a great glaze for grilled chicken Equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a touch of sesame oil for a Korean style dipping sauce Soy sauce and brown sugar makes teriyaki sauce Black bean hummus and fish sauce makes a really remarkable Korean inspired sauce for tofu Soy sauce mixed with tahini for a super great sesame glaze for chicken Soy sauce and lime juice is a great dipping sauce for fish or dumplings Rice vinegar and cucumber makes a great refreshing sauce for rice","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Sure thing, here is the recipe for a single drink: * 1 egg white * 2 oz earl grey infused gin (see below) * 1 oz simple syrup * 1 oz lemon juice Add all ingredients plus some ice in a bar shaker, shake vigorously and then pour into your martini glass, careful to ensure that no ice gets in. For the gin, you literally steep earl grey tea bags inside a bottle of gin. For a 26oz bottle, I usually use 4 tea bags and let it steep for around 4 hours. After that, strain the gin to remove the tea bags and then pour it back into the bottle. The recipe was obtained from a local bar, and these are the specific tea bags they use (and that I use too since the difference between them and a normal earl grey is very noticeable).","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Once cooked, as far as I understand it, it looses its positive properties and can actually be harmful - I've heard people claim this but I am having trouble finding any source. Perhaps a biologist or chemist can opine. Nevertheless, take any pan over high heat and let it get hot, but not so hot that it will scald olive oil in seconds. Also, preheat oven to 350, say. Season raw chicken directly. put in a tablespoon or so of OO and once shimmering, place chix in pan. Don't touch. Let brown. The chicken will release itself, even from a non-stick pan. Once it's cooked about 1/2 way through, just take the pan (assuming it's oven safe) and put the whole thing in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Don't undercook, but please... please... don't overcook the damn thing. Remove from oven and take out of pan. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve. No fancy dressing required as the browned meat has a lot of flavor. Also, you can take this and use it in any number of dishes (over salad, chinese chix salad, sandwiches, pastas, etc.)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"They're not hard to cook, they're hard to cook perfectly. EDIT: cooking at home and cooking in a restaurant are about as far apart as taking your car to the store and driving in an F1 race. That, and the contestants on Hell's Kitchen are not the most shining examples of skilled professionals. When they cook the dish, they've got a dozen other things not only to think about, but also to do. Not just that, but when the dish is fired, they've got to match it up with upwards of 4-5 other dishes going out. This creates problems and challenges. You have to communicate with other people who aren't extremely skilled at what they're doing, and rely on them to let you know how long it's taking them to complete their task. It's really not as simple as sticking it in the oven and taking it out when the timer beeps. It's more like - I've got 5 wellington on order, 4 fired, going with 3 lamb, just coming off my station. Now, I've also got to make sure that they finish exectly when 4 lobster, 6 scollop, and a vegetarian risotto. Oh, wait, in the middle of all of this, someone sent back a lamb I have to refire not because it was mistemped, but because it's a tv show and they scripted someone to send back food to test me on how I can adapt. And that isn't even a difficult rush for your normal everyday neighborhood bistro. So, while you may sit there and say to yourself, \"How difficult is that? I could do what they're doing.\" I assure you, the standard they're being asked to meet is one that far exceeds yours, and the sheer number of tasks they have to perform in the course of 20 minutes of a good rush in the kitchen exceeds the amount of tasks you perform in the average week in yours.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

In the morning clean the salt off (some people wash the meat, I never do because Raymond Blanc says not to). Put in a casserole dish or similar and cover with duck or goose fat and cook in the oven on a very low heat for about 4 hours. Shred the meat and let it cool before adding 1-2tbsp of chestnut puree, 2 tbsp chopped chives and enough heavy cream to bimd it all together. Taste and adjust according to your preference. If it's too salty add more cream. This also freezes really well and can be used to made duck bon bons by rolling the mix into balls, refrigerating to firm them up, then breadcrumbing and deep frying.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"My gf and I prepare a casserole or large dish every Sunday night, which serves as dinner and makes 3-4 lunches for both of us throughout the week. We also freeze some and rotate them, so we might eat the same one 2-3 times and take one from a previous week. We generally rotate around: * Lentil dahl or variation of some lentil dish. * Lasagna or some other pasta dish. Sometimes with meat, sometimes without. Rigatoni with italian sausage is one of my favs. * Mexican casserole with beans, corn, cheese., or some combo of tex-mex inspired food that does large portions like tons of fajitas (which freeze great), or a big enchilada casserole. * Big batch of stew or curry with lots of vegetables. Basically anything that doesn't take too long to make a big batch of, is healthy and is lunchable. Of course we'll make food with leftovers sometimes during the week, but I find it better to eat a salad or sandwich (which aren't great to keep overnight) at night and take my big meal at lunch. Furthermore, IMO, it's not really efficient to spend time cooking the night before if you're not planning on making a meal out of it. If you're gonna be in the kitchen, might as well eat, right? :) Extend that, and the best way to spend your kitchen time is to prep a lot of food in advance. If you really need a quick meal to prepare as a last minute thing to make a lunch, like the other commenters said, sandwiches are the quickest. But the feeling of popping out a beautiful, warm dish at lunch that keeps you filled for the next 4-5+ hours is more pleasant.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Not really what you asked, but my main kitchen knife is a Chinese cleaver. It has a long, slightly curved edge that allows you to chop like a santoku, but allows for the rocking motion like a chef's knife. The wide blade allows me to smash and scoop anything I want with ease. It also allows me to \"sight\" my cuts- by looking down the spine of my blade toward the edge, I can align it so that I know I'm cutting perfectly downward. The wide blade is also good for using the \"claw grip\" because you can always rest your knuckles against it. With a less wide blade, sometimes your knuckles can slip above the spine of the knife if you are cutting something tall. I also feel like it's safer. It doesn't have a sharp point (it does have corners, though) so there's no stabbing hazard. If I need to poke something, I have my paring knife on hand.

Despite its name, a \"utility\" knife is pretty useless. Mostly for fruits and such that are too bulky for a paring knife. It's not made for meats or fish or bread or cheese. 5) Paring knife.

{"text":"You mentioned pulled pork, so this jumped to mind. for an amazing NC-style pulled pork BBQ from hog to plate, make sure to mop the pork with the vinegar BBQ sauce. Even if you can't do a whole hog and are instead smoking (preferred) or roasting a pork butt or shoulder, open the door every so often, remove any outer shell of cooked meat and baste with some sauce. As for the sauce, every NC BBQ master has their own recipe, but if you really want that sauce to pop, add some red pepper flakes and bring the concoction to a boil. That helps the flavors to blend. Alternately, you can just let the sauce sit overnight to blend a little. I'm from NC and now live in VA. We tried a new BBQ place in MD, so of course, I tried some of their pulled pork and sauce. the pork was pretty good (hickory smoked), but I almost wept at the sauce: apple cider vinegar, a little sugar, some salt, and pre-ground black pepper. It was so bland and just tasted like pepper. edit: One more trick for pecan pie. I use 2.5 cups of pecan halves per pie, which mounds up nicely with the custard base. I also use a basting brush to spread chocolate liqueur on the crust. A former co-worker shunned my pie at a company potluck, saying he hated pecan pies.

{"text":"The Italian term is a \u201cpunch\u201d of salt. It means a solid fist of salt. Maybe 1/4 cup to a good sized pot? More of you use a larger pot. The pasta soaks up a little water but the brine is very dilute. If you add no salt you can\u2019t actually taste any of the pasta. Yuck. I like noodle flavoured noodles. That\u2019s like a sandwich where you can\u2019t taste the bread. A missing component. The saltier the brine the more flavour. Until you pass the point of ridiculousness and get salty noodles. But that requires a lot of salt to water ratio. For the average family cooking for three or four in a large pot a good handful is about right. Don\u2019t fear salt.

{"text":"The food bible is an awesome reference book if you're not super confident as it's basically an encyclopedia in which you look up one ingredient and it lists which spices, sides, etc. to pair. There are also recipes in it as well! I will also suggest that you stick with some classic pairings (usually French is most familiar to Americans). For example: beef is traditionally served with a simple pan sauce or a horseradish cream sauce. Salmon and dill are a no brainer! ( try taking those traditional pairings and seasonings and using them in creative ways, like horseradish cream mashed potatoes with steak, or dill and bacon creamed corn with salmon) Pairing a meat with something that it often eats is also a great strategy. EX: chickens eat grains, seeds, and even berries, so a roasted chicken breast with a balsamic berry sauce and some wild rice or farro is guaranteed to be delicious! Good luck!!!","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Despite what that product info says, putting them in the dishwasher is asking for your handles to get ruined and also for your blades to get banged up against other blades and things, dulling them quickly. Leaving them to soak in a sink is asking to get a chunk of finger lopped off when you go to reach in there for something. Dry them straightaway (mind your fingers!) and store them exclusively in that knife block or on a magnetic strip, but never bare in a drawer, as all that rattling will lead to dull banged-up knives as well. Get a decent-quality honing steel and give the knives a good few strokes every couple of days or so if you use them often. Don't use glass cutting boards as they're awful for a blade.

{"text":"Separate the eggs before \"boiling\" the whites. Place about 6 whites in a good quality ziplock bag, removing all the air by submerging the bag to the ziplock line as you seal it. This is really easy once you start doing it and see how water pressure conforms the bag to the whites. 172F is your target temperature, if you have a thermometer (and you really should, even a cheap one works for this sort of thing), hold at 172F for about 15 minutes and peel your perfectly cooked egg whites from their bag whenever is convenient over the next few days. Without a thermometer, my best guess would be to bring 6 cups of water to a boil, dip out 3 1/2 cups and add 3 cups of bath warm hot water to it then add the egg whites (splitting the 212F of boiling with the 110ish F of hot bath water to be about 172F). Add about 3/4C of boiling water every 5 minutes to maintain the heat, but really just buy a thermometer if after one try you like the method. Extra egg yolks around here, and especially in the spring when asparagus beckons, become hollandaise.

Even things like \"medium heat\" or \"simmer until it's softened\" will frustrate the hell out of him. I'm sure he'll learn to watch, smell, listen and remember in time. But for someone with no frame of reference, it's hard to learn from what you're doing wrong if you don't know what exactly you're doing wrong (did I add too much of something or rather too little).","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Another is a pomodoro, which is perfect during the summer especially, when you can get good ripe tomatoes and fresh basil. Just mince up some garlic, dice the tomatoes. Heat a bit of olive oil in a skillet, add the garlic. Cook about 2 minutes, add the tomatoes. Let them simmer and soften a bit, toss in the pasta, tossing around while it gets hot. Top with a chiffonade of basil and some parm and fresh cracked pepper. Another quick and delicious sauce: cut a couple slices of bacon into small pieces and fry them up. Drain off the fat, add in some garlic and finely chopped onion. Toss around a bit until the garlic is golden and the onion is beginning to caramelize. Add in some heavy cream, parmesan cheese, fresh cracked pepper. Simmer a couple minutes, it will thicken up a bit. Add in a bit of spaghetti sauce (from a jar is fine). Toss with the pasta.

{"text":"Only if you promise to let me know how you liked it :) Make sure you pop the ice cream attachment and the beater blade for it in the coldest part of your freezer for at least a day in advance for best results. Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder * 1 Cup Heavy Cream * 3 Cups Half and Half * 8 Egg Yolks * 9 Ounces Sugar * 2 Tsp Vanilla * 7 Ounces Milk Chocolate 1. In saucepan over medium heat, mix cocoa powder with 1 cup of half and half cream. Combine fully (no cocoa powder chunks!) and and the remaining half and half as well as the heavy cream. Bring to a simmer 2. Whisk the egg yolks until they are lighter in colour, then gradually add the sugar. 3. Slowly add 1/3 of the simmering cream mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly (this tempers the egg mixture). Once you've combined them thoroughly, pour this mix back into the saucepan on low heat. Whisk to combine. 4. Cook this mixture, stirring often, until it reaches 170\u00b0-175\u00b0 F. 5. Stir in vanilla and chocolate, then set aside until it reaches room temperature. (You should totally taste it now. This is a preview of the nirvana you will enjoy shortly.) 6. Refrigerate the mixture until it reaches 40\u00b0 F, then pop it in the kitchenaid ice cream maker and let it do it's thing. Make sure you turn the mixer on *before* you add the ice cream batter to it, or it won't churn as well. I like to shave some dark chocolate (or a white kit kat bar) and add it to the ice cream a minute or two before it comes out. When your kitchenaid starts clicking as it turns, your ice cream is pretty much done. Serve immediately if you ~~have no self control~~ like soft serve, or let it sit covered in the freezer for a few hours for a firmer texture. This ice cream is so silky smooth and rich - I hope you enjoy it! We also really like to add Bailey's, orange liqueur, chopped frozen berries, and toasted coconut flakes (not all together, of course - that would be madness!)

{"text":"Summer or winter truffles? Generally speaking, winter has more pronounced flavour &amp; goes really well in cooking, as the flavour seeps throughout. A little goes a long way.

I wouldn\u2019t keep it for longer than a week in this fashion, as you\u2019ll start to lose the aroma &amp; damp will promote mould growth. If desired, shave and infuse into oil, then you\u2019ll have your very own truffle oil, which you can use to flavour anything you fancy, or as a very indulgent finishing oil. Best uses for fresh truffle are: shaved on top of a cream sauce based pasta dish (either microplane or very fine shavings, you can also put into the sauce itself though truffle oil is generally better in the sauce), shaved over poached eggs or mixed into scrambled eggs, in cream based sauces, microplaned into whipped butter, shaved on top of beef, added into silky smooth mashed potato, or the ever classic truffle risotto (add the truffle in the last 10 minutes of cooking, as cooking truffle for too long will result in a loss of aroma) - the uses are endless!

Best way to have sanitizer solution around when you hardly would use it. I know in fast food we always had a dish of it around and it was fantastic for quick cleanups, but it gets really dirty. I just keep clorox wipes around and do a pass of wipe and another pass with a damp paper towel to get the residue off. Especially if meat gets somewhere. Is this probably the best alternative for home? That's one thing I've realized working fast food and the bit of restaurant chains, scaling makes some stuff so much easier. Like, I can't just go get my container of chopped onions, I have to sit there and chop one up, possibly dirty a dish to store it (if I need the cutting board) and repeat for pretty much everything. Dishes at home will almost always take a bit longer, kind of goes to your first point minimal ingredients can be great not only for flavor but ease of cooking. Of note with thermometers, try to get a thermocouple, not the run of the mill cheap thermometer. Thermocouples usually have a tiny taper at the end the size of a pencil led and only needs the very edge of the tip to read, so you don't have to lance your food to death to get a valid reading.

I have interacted with literally 100's more who have been inspired to pass on hot pockets or the olive garden to try and cook something themself. And despite what you say Alton espouses exactly what you claim to extol - being more self sufficient in the kitchen. While some things are obviously foolish or silly sniping at a successful TV chef that inspires thousands upon thousands who, unlike you, can use some judgement and overlook or ignore poor suggestions like drill powered pepper grinders doesn't make sense. Instead of being jealous and negative why not ignore him or find the positive in his successes? Here is one success that Alton Brown has achieved: He inspired me to learn to cook. As a result, both my daughters learned to cook and as a direct result I teach a one week girl scout class on ow to cook. I teach local college kids how to cook (also in a one week class). I also teach kids at summer camp how to cook (two weeks a year). So, yeah, no. Alton Brown is not fucking my wife. He is a successful and inspirational TV cook. You are not in competition with him nor is he you. But no matter how good you can prepare food I'd give AB's restaurant a shot way before I gave yours a chance. Why? Even if you were the better chef? Easy, both of you cook to earn money. But AB does it while making the world a slightly better place (either by chance or design)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}
{"text":"I would recommend the Zojirushi NeuroFuzzy rice cooker. My son eats rice with every meal and one of my roommates is Korean; this machine makes it super easy to keep perfect rice on hand at all hours. It also does sweet rice, brown rice, porridge. I have made oatmeal in it. It has a timer, so you can set it up at night and it can have breakfast ready for you in the morning. It has an internal battery backup so that if the power goes out of you need to unplug it and move it, it goes right back to where it was in the cooking cycle. Plus it plays cute little tunes when it starts and when it's done. We've been using it daily for ten years, and it's still going strong. Super useful, although not the same kind of useful as the kinds of rice cookers that are on/off and can steam stuff.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Hey, author of the post here. Here's a link to an article I wrote which has a bit more background info on the smashing technique. You're absolutely right - you want to smash at the beginning, but not once it starts cooking and the fat begins to liquefy. Smash once, leave it alone. As for the shrinking bit, that's why I use a stainless steel skillet with no oil in it. The meat binds to the metal (through actual covalent bonds!) when you press it down, so it keeps its size as it browns and sets. Then you scrape it up with a really stiff scraper or spatula. If you're talking about a more standard burger and not a smashed patty, then you'll want to make it slightly larger than the bun to start, and put a dimple in the center, which accounts for the fact that the edges cook (and therefore shrink) more than the center does. This compensates for the bulging that would happen if you cook a totally flat burger. More info on that here.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"There's something psychological at play here. Your ego is overriding your love for your partner. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a mechanical thing, which is extremely common and also easy to fix when you recognize it. Anyone who loves cooking is heavily invested in it as part of who they are. We live and breathe food. It's on our minds all the time. And the dark side of it is that when our loves and hobbies determine aspects of our personality we can also judge others. For example, if you have a strong opinion about someone who eats well done steaks with ketchup lol But in all honesty it's very trivial, right? A person's food preference. We are artists and culinary integrity is in our souls. Some people don't speak the language and it's not on them. So the complex act of cooking for your loved one, you need to split it apart. You don't need to inject culinary integrity into every act of cooking. The slight resentment you feel is actually that judgment that comes as the result of our obsession with food. Feeding your loved one should go in a different bucket, the fulfillment of doing something for them the way they like and making them happy. So if your partner just wants a kid's meal, make that kids meal, plate it nicely, get two small cups for ranch and bbq and just bask in the admiration of your partner gleefully and appreciatingly eating something you prepared, whether it's up to your standards or not. You can talk to us in the language of Food, and your partner in the language of Love. All the best","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

I think the vitamix is a good choice if you plan on doing more than just making juice. PS it's not a cheap motor. the base is relatively heavy and i must've used the product over 200+ already (other people in my household use it daily, too). the motor is still running and the blades are still \"extracting.\" as for its power, i put in almonds, chia seeds, flax seeds, frozen fruits etc. and it blends everything just fine. i've never had an issue with the nutribullet not blending the stuff i put in it. if you have any questions, pm me. fyi, i'm just a consumer.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"I've read a lot about how professional chefs use a microwave. They say it's good for boiling water quickly and softening butter, and that's about it. They don't use it to reheat foods or cook because of the way they work. A microwave reheats food in a really weird way. There are hot spots and it cooks very weirdly. I got tired of eating food that has been reheated in such a weird way. Again, I feel like microwaves are a 1970s fad, and most people would do well to use a microwave much less. I got rid of mine years ago, and each time I consider buying one I talk myself out of it since the use is so limited. I have an electric kettle and I'm not regularly softening butter. Unless you're drinking extreme amounts of soda, you can get 2L bottles of soda for about $0.50-$0.70. The time it takes to offset the purchase price of the machine and bottles is like 10 years. Also soda should be seen as a treat, if you're drinking soda water daily you're not living frugally, no matter how you get your soda.

In re. \"I would like some main dishes though that we could all possibly enjoy\" -- sometimes it can be frustrating for vegetarians to sit down to a meal and discover that all they can eat is an uninspired salad and some dinner rolls. That blows. But at a big holiday feast I think most of us are totally fine with having something like a slew of roasted veg be our main dish. Omnivores tend to get stuck on the idea that there must be a main dish and it must be protein; vegetarians I've known are fine with, well, green bean casserole as a 'main dish.'

Those restaurants require equipment so restaurant supply stores open up to meet that demand, they do sell to regular consumers too but their main customers are professional kitchens. A lot of what they do is act as distributors for commercial kitchen equipment manufacturers. Things like ranges, fryers, commercial refrigerators, industrial dishwashers etc. A good example of one that is online is https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ The restaurant supply stores will also have a cookware, cutlery, and tools area that sell things for use in the kitchen. Restaurant supply store equipment usually doesn't appeal to everyday consumers, they are very utilitarian. They also have minimal packaging and labeling, it is meant to last in a kitchen processing large amounts of food continuously, most will be bulkier than the consumer equivalents too. Most home consumers have a preference for nicer looking kitchenware.

I also lost interest in all of my main hobbies (skateboarding, hiking, guitar, etc.) but for some reason was still able to get myself to cook every other day. It would start early in the day just when I would get hungry and think about what I could cook for dinner that night. Finally I would get excited about something and spend time looking up recipes, going to the store and more. My goal some days would be to cook something complex, difficult and time consuming, just so I would spend more time being happy cooking. I guess I am just glad that I am not the only one who feels this way, as cooking was literally my go-to activity to anytime I was getting down and in my head. Keep up the good fight and I will recommend exercise as my other favorite tool in fighting depression.

{"text":"Shortening != margarine. It's any cooking fat that's saturated enough to prevent crosslinking of gluten (therefore 'shortening' the chains of gluten molecules). Lard is actually not good for that purpose, as it's barely solid at room temperature, being only 40% saturated fatty acids. Leaf lard, which is found around the kidneys of the pig, is a good bit more saturated and actually suitable for the purpose. If you want a good shortening use something with a higher melting point like tallow or mutton fat. Palm oil or palm kernel oil also work better than lard.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

A mainly veggie dish, but with a couple of rashers of bacon (We use english bacon) chopped up and cooked with it makes it 90% veggies, but very tasty and satisfying. There's something about roasted cauliflower with cumin that is very meatish. Very nice side. Most importantly, experiment. I know it's hard when you're cooking for just yourself, but it's the best time to experiment with different dishes because no-one will suffer except yourself. Enjoy experimenting. You don't need to make \"veggie\" dishes, but experiment with how little meat you can include in a dish and still make it delicious.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Burritos are really easy. You can buy the wrappers pretty cheap - when you get more adventurous, they're really easy to make by hand as well. The filling we like is: * 1 T cooking oil * half dozen fresh roma tomatoes, chopped * 3 to 6 serrano chilies, diced - or even more if like us you live on the east coast where the available fresh chilies are so mild you can barely taste them. * 1 to 2 tsp minced garlic (or 1 to 2 cloves of fresh garlic put through a garlic press). The minced garlic in the grocery store is generally super-mild, I get better, stronger garlic either at Costco or from an ethnic grocery (pre-minced stuff in jars). * large onion, chopped coarsely * Bell pepper, chopped coarsely * 1 can of black beans, DRAINED * 1 tsp ground cumin * 2 tsp chili powder * shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco - or just buy some pre-shredded Kraft Mexican Mix * sour cream * cilantro, chopped Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet. Dump in the onions and SERRANO peppers and garlic, and stir the spice in with them. Cook over med to med high heat, stirring pretty constantly, until the onions are starting to soften - the edges will start to look translucent, but the centers will still be white. Dump in the BELL pepper and stir fry a couple more minutes. Now add the tomatoes. Stir fry a couple of minutes. Dump in the (drained) beans. Stir well and let cook down so the moisture cooks off. Just stir once in awhile to keep it from sticking/burning. Meanwhile, take 2 burrito wrappers per person, wrap in foil, place on the top rack of the oven, and turn the oven on to about 400F. They will be heated through in 5 mins or so. If your oven is one of the dumb ovens that turns the top element on while preheating, place the wrappers on the BOTTOM rack. Too close to the broiler and they'll turn hard and won't wrap. They make fairly tasty dipping-chips though. When the tomatoes are done, turn off the burner, take a wrapper, slap a spoonful of the above filling in the center. Top with cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro. Fold the bottom edge a couple inches up over the filling. Put a dab of sour cream on the flap. Fold the left edge over and put a dab of sour cream along that flap. Fold the final edge over top of that. The sour cream will make the burrito wrapper stick closed. Chow down. I know, it's meatless. If you must have meat, you can add some shredded or finely sliced cooked beef or some cooked chicken at the end with the beans. Grilled or blackened chicken is pretty tasty in a burrito. It's just easier to make it without, unless and until you get the whole basic cooking thing down.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Casual (jeans and a shirt) environment, you kept one fork for the whole meal (they suggest just giving it a lick as prep for the next course), communal tables, and course after course of amazing food. After several years, several meals (including a brunch I still dream about) they went legit and opened a brick and mortar restaurant. Prices went waaaay up - I think it was about 65-80/person at the pop up and now I think it\u2019s hovering around 150-200/person. I have eaten at their legit restaurant twice and I have to say it\u2019s just as good as it was before, you just get more forks. Still pretty casual, but that\u2019s pretty typical for SF. I feel very fortunate to have been able to eat with them so many times both before and after they \u201cmade it\u201d. I would absolutely love to try The French Laundry one day, but besides more meals at Lazy Bear, I don\u2019t have any huge burning desires to seek out any more Michelin starred restaurants. I think finding locals who know the food scene who can point you to some up-and-coming restaurants is probably the way to go. There\u2019s so much talent out there, and you don\u2019t need a Michelin Guide to find it :)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

I think the only determining factors in how long you keep the oil is (a) how much crap you leave floating around in there, and (b) how many times you use it. After 3 or 4 batches in the same oil, I'll do a test run with one piece of whatever I'm frying. You can tell when your oil is too old, because too much oil gets absorbed without driving off enough water, so you get soggy/greasy instead of crisp fried goodies. But here's a trick I took away from all my years in food service - I save a portion of the old grease (not much, a cup at most) and mix it into the new.

{"text":"I'm not trying to pick apart your technique, but artisan pizza has been an obsession of my over the last few years and I think that I can offer some suggestions which may help even further improve your pizza, if you're interested. If nothing else, this may be a brain dump for anyone interested. Rising bread in the oven is a no-no; rising shouldn't happen in environments above 80F and it will likely dry out the outside of the dough at that temp. Slow ferment=flavor. Most people these days actually prefer a slow ferment in the fridge for ~12-24h. I like to then let it sit on the counter for ~3 hours after fridge ferment that before shaping, but some people say only 45m-1h is necessary. Also, you don't need pizza dough to double in size. Most bread bakers actually say it's not about volume increase, but the feel that lets you know when your bread is ready. If you're hand kneading you can knead for 45 minutes, but its pretty easy to overknead with a mixer. I prefer the romantic nature of working with my hands with the dough, so I really can't comment much on automatic kneading. I just took a bread class from some crazy French guy that makes amazing bread, though, and he says he recommends no more than ~10 minutes on the mixer. If you're working with wet dough, this French Fold technique is great (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvdtUR-XTG0) and the secret is to pull it off the counter real quick. Quick sharp movements. I've never had good luck with the broiler. I have a gas stove, though, so my broiler doesnt seem to get as hot. I can get a stone to ~660F without any oven tricks. I like to be at around 730-750 since I prefer a Neapolitan style. Sometimes I'll throw a frozen washcloth on the oven's thermometer to get into the temperature I like to bake at, though you need to remember to take that off when you're done (true story). Google 'Little Black Egg' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtXTMufUMh0) if you are interested in an affordable outdoor pizza oven (this may be a summer project for me) capable of getting into Neapolitan temps. If I could boil down my beginner mistakes, they would be: * Measure ingredients out on a scale. Measuring flour by volume is too inaccurate. * Don't fear wet dough, and don't reach for flour when it is too wet. Trust the hydration ratio when you're starting out. Kneading will transform the gluten into something workable. The more flour you add, the more uniform your dough is going to become. 60% is a good place where it is manageable, yet still rewarding. * Preheat the stone for 1+ hour. Get that sucker hoooooot. Verify temp with an IR thermometer. The hotter you get it , the more open crumb (big flavorful holes) you get because you get better oven spring. * Use sauce and toppings minimally, or deal with your pizza sticking to your peel. * Work fast while preparing the pizza with toppings.

Pour in the pumpkin and stock and whisk together. Add salt and pepper, then either season further with a tablespoon of red curry paste or literally whatever seasonings you want! I usually use a squirt of sriracha, a few shakes of onion powder, and pinches of cinnamon, oregano, paprika, and thyme (tasting and adding as you go is important with this recipe). Let heat on medium-low for 8 minutes. While this is cooking, make the chicken. Whisk in the coconut milk, add in the cooked, shredded chicken, and continue to let cook on medium-low for 10 more minutes. Bam, delicious, super hearty soup. The chicken can be replaced with other proteins, the pumpkin pur\u00e9e can be replaced with other pur\u00e9ed vegetables, and it can be made for vegetarians or meat lovers. Add corn, add black beans, add crumbled bacon, whatever you want! I have made so many variations.

Extra-virgin olive oil DOES have a low smoke point, and should mainly not be used in heat applications. 3. (This I had to realize myself) If you put something in the oven at 400, it doesn't mean everything within that oven gets to 400 degrees. The oil drizzled on top of your pizza, or cooking your roasted whatever, isn't that hot. It's frequently still below the olive oil smoke point.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"There are tons of great macaroni &amp; cheese recipes, but the basic recipe is good to know, because the base of the cheese sauce, your basic white sauce, can be modified to any taste. You basically start by making a roux, which is equal parts butter &amp; flour (you can use oil instead of butter, but the flavor will change). I normally do 4 T butter to 1/4 cup flour. Melt the butter, then add the flour, and cook until it's golden, maybe around 5 minutes (don't skip this step, otherwise the sauce will taste like flour). At this time you can add salt/pepper/dried spices. Once that's incorporated, add milk (I use 2 cups), then cook over medium heat till bubbly. At this point, you can add shredded cheddar or any other type of cheese. I use cheddar with a bit of freshly grated reggiano parmesan. I'd use about 2 cups cheese total for this recipe. Be sure to add the cheese off of the heat; it will melt right in. Add to cooked macaroni, and you're good to go.

Brown the meat, remove, caramelize the onions, add the carrots, lentils, stock, simmer for 15 minutes, add back the meat, and simmer for 15-20 minutes longer (add some water throughout the process if needed).

{"text":"The main problem is that customers don't realize that by sacrificing their local stores to save a few cents, they are shifting their locally-earned income to a company that doesn't put the same amount of money back into the local economy. In fact, they go to the trouble of putting as little as possible back in by producing all of the products they sell in the countries that can do it for the least amount of money and paying their employees the bare minimum. Yes, it's a hassle to have to drive to a store that sells vegetables and then go to a store that sells screwdrivers, and it may cost less, but the people who check you out aren't taking the vast majority of the money you spent on either item and spending it at a store that *you* own, continuing the cycle of the local economy. It goes to the Walmart company, which will almost definitely not be buying whatever products are made in *your* town. So yes, it might be cheaper when you're on a tiny budget (I am right now), but sooner or later, your town won't be able to sell anything because either Walmart will sell it cheaper, or you won't be making enough money to buy it because no one is buying anything at *your* place of business. Walmart is the \"kingpin it is today\" because people don't have enough foresight to buy local, and then they complain that there aren't enough jobs, but it's because they're supporting companies that don't give a shit about anything but their quarterly statement, and will exploit anyone's instinct to buy the cheapest product even though it's not a sustainable business model. They'll be laughing their way to the bank, and by the time people realize that they can't even afford Walmart prices any more, Walmart will be able to pack up and go home. People are ignorant, and they're going to pay the price, but until they see the bill, it's not an issue for them. No, it's not that simple, but the people who shop at Walmart don't have the where-with-all to see the problem before it kicks them in the ass, and they aren't going to go to the trouble to find out.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Since I was grilling on a park grill, I ended up using a metal grill mat with holes from Home Depot (don't remember the name). If you are grilling at home and don't want to bother with the clean up, I'm not sure what to suggest. Edit: We bought Costco Kirkland brand Hamburger Patties. They lack seasoning so I suggest using Lawry's Season Salt and put a good amount on each side.

Can either be done in a slow cooker or in the oven on low (just adjust the cooking times a bit), pretty cheap in terms of ingredients and a real crowd pleaser. Recipe: For the chicken with spice butter: 50g room temp butter 1 tsp paprika Zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp dried oregano 2 garlic cloves, minced Salt and pepper 1 whole chicken, about 1.5kg For the veggies: 2 red peppers in chunks 2 onions in 1/8ths 1 punnet cherry tomatoes 3 carrots, in batons 3 tsp fennel seeds 1 whole head of garlic, topped 1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar 250ml/1 cup white wine Salt and pepper For roast potatoes: 6 medium maris piper potatoes in chunks Sage Instructions: This recipe requires a slow cooker with an oven safe pot. Preheat the oven to 220C. Prepare the spice butter by mixing butter, paprika, oregano, zest, garlic to make a paste and spread all over the chicken, including putting some under the breast skin if you like. Brown in the oven for about 15 minutes breast side up. While the chicken is in the oven, prepare all the vegetables to go straight into the slow cooker (excluding the potatoes, which go into a pan of cold water, bring to boil and parboil for about 7 minutes). When the chicken comes out the oven, transfer to the slow cooker, breast down (reserve the fat in the pan for potatoes). Add the wine, vinegar and fennel seeds. Set the slow cooker to high for one hour, after which switch it to low for 3 hours. When the potatoes are parboiled, drain the pan, add sage and then with the lid on give the pan a good rattle to fluff the potatoes up a bit and set aside. Once the 4 hours of slow cooking are up, preheat the oven to 190C. Place the potatoes into the roasting pan with reserved chicken fat plus a little olive oil if need be, and put in the oven along with the crock pot (lid off) to finish off for one hour.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Learn the difference between cutting with a sharp knife and a dull knife, and then *never* use a dull knife again because that's how you lose a finger. Either can cut you, but only a dull knife is unpredictable. Taste every spice and every ingredient you can. Once in awhile, I'll even risk a bite of raw meat or egg just to better understand the flavor I'm working with. Ruin dishes. Add a sprinkle of salt, taste, and add a sprinkle more. Try to identify where the perfect amount is, then go past it to confirm that you added too much. Same goes for how long you bake something for, how much you thicken a soup/sauce, etc. etc. The point here is that learning happens by trying something new, regardless of whether or not it's going to turn out well (which it often won't).

{"text":"You could be trying to flip it too early, it could be your spatula or it could be the pan. I have one that is plastic and the tip has started to get a bit rough. Crepes are very delicate and worn spatula will definitely catch. What you can do to make it easier is first get the corner of the spatula like 1/2\" under the edge of the crepe and just follow the outside of the pan lifting that corner. If you wait till they are a bit more cooked, this becomes easier. Once you've done that shake the the pan to and away from you quickly - or side to side - to get the crepe loose. Tilt the pan forward and let the crepe slide a bit to one side. This should make it a lot easier to work the spatula under it. If that fails try this: get corner of spatula under the the crepe, then with your finger gently lift the crepe a bit and work the spatula under a bit more. Don't burn your finger, so do this in like 3 - 4 steps but you should be able to get all the way under it.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

If you really want to get fancy, get an oyster/clam shucking station outside, but don't forget the ice and plenty of hand towels. Get a grill for the pit and parcook some lobster tail (you can find them cheap if you know where to look) on the night before.

{"text":"I think the best thing to do is give it a trial run. Make some, refrigerate it overnight, and then see how it tastes. If you're particularly devoted, make a fresh batch the next day and taste-test them. Personally, I'm of the opinion that some stews- seafood chowders in particular- actually taste better after they've had a day to mellow. This is definitely true for my fish chowder. However, it may also be a matter of personal taste. My mother always told me that growing up, so I could simply have rose-colored glasses. One thing the be aware of is that spicy foods tend to get spicier when you heat them. Be aware of this if you're going to heat *and* reheat the food. Ultimately, the best thing to do is to make it according to recipe, and as the previous poster said, have some extra essence on hand the day of the wedding.

Definitely save that one for drizzling over tomatoes and pasta, and stick with the veggie oil if you're going to saute or fry anything. bonus trick for frying / deep frying: As the oil gets cool enough to handle (but not cold), get a sieve and a coffee filter and put it over a jar. Slowly pour the oil through the filter to get the majority of the particles out of it, then seal up the jar. Next time you're going to fry, dump that oil in the pan, and then add some NEW oil of the same kind (preferably) and start the heat. As it starts to warm up, but a wedge of potato in the oil. Let it sit in there while it heats and starts to sizzle and bubble. Take the potato out once it's browned and toss it.

It was more or less made up on the fly, but came out unexpectedly good. First, sliced onion, red and green bell pepper, and tomatos from a can were arranged on a baking sheet, brushed with oil, salt, and spices, and roasted in the oven. The chicken was also brushed with oil, salt, and seasonings, and browned in a hot pan. Once browned, the chicken was removed and the heat lowered, and some minced garlic and anchovies were sweated in a little oil. Then I added beef stock, the liquid from the can of tomatos, some tomato paste, and let that come to a simmer to reduce. The liquid was then further thickened with a cornstarch slurry, the roasted vegetables and chicken were added to the pan, and the whole thing continued to cook for maybe 10-15 minutes longer.

{"text":"I\u2019ve had salmon sashimi many times; it is delicious and buttery. However, sashimi fish is usually of a very high grade and is prepared a certain way, as so not to harm those who consume it.

You don\u2019t want to end up with food poisoning.

{"text":"Not at all a stupid question. Actually, it's a really interesting one that I could go on about at length. [After writing my comment, I look back and see that I do go on at length...] Essentially, it depends on what you want out of a pizza, or rather, what your idea of pizza is. It also depends on what your idea of tomato sauce is. As an American who grew up in Philadelphia in an Italian-American family, we ate a lot of \"gravy\" when I was younger. I don't know the secrets that went into the gravy that my grandmother and great aunts made, but I do know how my dad made it - lots of sausage, meatballs, and some other meat simmered for a long time in tomato sauce that is flavored with garlic and onion. Often there would be dried basil incorporated into this as well. This is what I think of as the quintessential version of \"spaghetti sauce\" in America - tomato, garlic/onion, meat, and long simmering. This sauce is meaningful to me, and it is delicious, but the way I think of Italian sauces these days is quite different. That Italian-American sauce came about via my Italian immigrant ancestors memories of their own Italian ancestors. It is an American memory of the old world that has become enshrined in the minds of many Americans as \"tomato sauce.\" So many people think of a tomato sauce as something that needs long simmering, always contains onion/garlic, and very often contains meat. If you look at Italian tomato sauces, however, this is not the case. There are many many tomato sauces for pasta in Italy. The one that is closest to the Italian-American version is probably Ragu Neapolitano, which contains beef and/or pork, onions, garlic, and long simmered tomatoes. But other sauces, like Marinara do not contain meat or onions and are cooked rapidly, creating a fresh tasting, bright red sauce with most of the natural acidity of the tomatoes intact. Marinara, as the name applies, is a sauce made by and for mariners and is great in a meal to complement oily fish like bluefish - you need that acidity to balance out the richness of the fish, and the brightness of the sauce is there to match a sunny, clear day by the water. It's a summery sauce that is light and is used for those occasions, whereas something like Ragu Neapolitano or Italian-American gravy is a heavier sauce that is better for cooler days or when you want to incorporate a big plate of meat into your table. So tomato sauces vary quite a bit and are made to suit the occasion, whether you want a lighter, brighter sauce or a richer, meatier sauce and everything in between. Now onto the pizza. I prefer thin crust, a bright tomato sauce, a relatively small amount of fresh mozz, and I go light on the toppings. I often top the pizza with a few olives or pickled peppadew peppers, and hit it with aged cheese and a few handfuls of arugula when it comes out of the oven. I might add some slices of soppressata when comes out of the oven as well. The toppings are just supporting characters; the essence of the pizza is a balance between crispy, chewy crust, bright tomato sauce, and a little richness form the cheese. If the sauce is too heavy and concentrated by being cooked down and having things like anchovy/Maggi/Worcestershire sauce or the sweetness of onions added to it, the sauce will be too rich to fulfill its function and the pizza will be out of balance for me. Now I say \"for me\" here purposefully, because a balanced pizza to me is a basic expression of bread, relatively unadorned tomato, and fresh cheese. It's straightforward and there's a clarity to it. That is not be everyone's vision of what pizza is, and typical American style pizza isn't about clarity and balance. The kind of pizza you will get 3/4 of the time if you randomly call a pizza place in most parts of the US will be balanced towards richness. It's frontloaded with sweetness from onions, concentrated by long cooking, and complicated with the addition of oregano and other seasonings. It resembles, to me, Italian-American tomato gravy in spirit - heavy and rich with an impression of abundance. This rich sauce is then combined with a fluffier dough that is often enriched with olive oil, milk, and even sugar sometimes whereas in contrast my dough is just a simple mixture of 500g flour, 375ml water, 14g salt, and a teaspoon of yeast. On top of that enriched dough there is a rich sauce, and on top of that rich sauce, there is rich, low moisture mozzarella cheese. And that is just before even more richness is added from toppings. I could go on, but I hope my point is made that there are two broad directions you can take with pizza - one with more balance between the elements that favors lightness, and one that is balanced toward richness. If you're going for the light version, which I prefer, then you don't want to overcook the sauce so as to retain the acidity of your tomatoes. If you're going for the richer version, you want to cook the sauce down so that you extract the maximum sweetness out of the onions, reduce the acidity of the sauce, and concentrate and thicken your tomatoes. It's all just a matter of style and preference. All pizza can be good pizza; the key is knowing what you're going for and executing. For many, cooked tomato sauce is the sauce of their memories and it's what they prefer. Whenever I'm cooking, I'm playing along with these memories - sometimes I play with them, sometimes against but they're always there and they shape how I think about what I'm making since what I'm making is an expression of my history, philosophy, and leads me into an unknown future - who knows what kind of pizza I'll be making in ten years? It will surely be different than what I do now. I'll be interested to see where it goes.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

When the slow cooker is done after 4-6 hours on high, shred the chicken into the remaining salsa compote and you have fantastic chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side.

Functionally it's the same as the dutch oven in terms of what you can make in it. Soup is an obvious choice but it can really be used for anything.

Unfortunately, you can't really determine the interior marbling with this method. I usually buy Kirkland Signature thick sliced center cut 2-pack (1.5lbs each). It's $10.99 (ish?) for 3lbs of totally decent bacon. It comes in a supposedly resealable zip-top bag, but I've never been able to open a package without destroying the zip top, so...not great on the packaging front. But good cheap bacon, and I can always pick up another lifetime supply of gallon zip bags while I'm at costco. When I'm not making a costco run, I always get bacon from the butcher counter rather than the bacon/sausage section of the meat case.

{"text":"Alright mate, here is the deal. I'm by no means a burger master, but I make a decent burger out of necessity, as there are very few burger places where I'm at (Abroad). Meat: 80/20 mince, divide and lightly form into patties, make it thinner than you think and pinch the center a little (it will puff up don't worry). Season generously with salt (preferably of the kosher or coarse variety), and rub it in. Pepper will burn. On the pan, put in some oil (can be as little or as much as a few millimeters). Put the heat on high and wait for the pan to get hot (Oil just about to smoke), then put the burgers on and don't touch them! wait a few moments then flip using a spatula. Wait until the juices run clear (or not), put the pepper and cheese on top now if you wish. Take it off and let it rest for a few minutes. Now the second ingredient which is often overlooked is bread. Put the broiler on. Butter generously, or you can mix olive oil and warm butter and drizzle (or drench!) on the bread. Stick it in the oven face up (broiler!) until it starts to get slightly golden/crispy. A good bun makes all the difference. An old stale bun can make even the best burger meat suck balls. For toppings I recommend thinly sliced dill pickles, sauteed/carmelized onions, tomatos, and maybe lettuce. I use mayo on bottom and BBQ sauce on top.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

You can do this under a broiler too but I prefer the grill. After you do that process your habeneros, I normally keep the ribs in because I like mine really hot. I then take the pineapple chunks and pur\u00e9e them in a food processor until smooth, then with the processor running I drizzle in two tbs of honey. Next I put in champagne vinegar, I've never measured this but I do it until it mellows out the sweetness a little bit. Next I put in the peppers and process until they are almost completely incorporated. I'd add one at a time until you figure out what heat level you want, it's all up to your taste.

{"text":"1) Although lengthy, seasoning with flaxseed oil is a mainly hands-off undertaking. We highly recommend the treatment: 1. Warm an unseasoned pan (either new or stripped of seasoning*) for 15 minutes in a 200-degree oven to open its pores. 2. Remove the pan from the oven. Place 1 tablespoon flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove excess oil. 3. Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour. Turn off the oven; cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours. 4. Repeat the process five more times, or until the pan develops a dark, semi-matte surface. *To strip a cast-iron pan of seasoning, spray it with oven cleaner, wait 30 minutes, wash with soapy water, and thoroughly wipe with paper towels.

{"text":"####Whole fish - Steamed in a banana leaf (or tinfoil) As promised to lacewingfly: *This is my favourite method of cooking a whole fish. I generally use snapper, but any white fish will work, it just needs to be a *reasonably* flat fish. The banana leaf can of course be substituted for tinfoil, but the flavour released from the leaf makes it worth it. The seasonings I am using here are for a ginger and garlic taste, but really you could use any asian seasonings (I've done this with thai green curry paste very successfully).* *This recipe is best cooked on a bbq (grill), but absolutely still delicious if cooked in the oven, so don't worry if you can only do indoor cooking, it'll still rock.* *As usual, all of my quantities are approximate. I eyeball ingredients and add more or less of certain things to my own personal taste, so they are a rough estimate. It seems like there are a lot of steps below, but they're all easy I promise.* OK here we go: ***What You'll need:*** * Whole snapper or similar, scaled, gutted, cleaned, spines removed. Your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask them nicely (if you do this yourself be very careful with the spines on a snapper, they are SHARP AS FUCK!) * Stalk of lemongrass * Spring onions (some for cooking, some for garnish) * Fresh garlic * Fresh ginger (I often advocate jars of minced garlic and ginger, but here fresher is better) * Light soy sauce * Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce, should be easily available) * Mild Long green chilli (we don't want this to be too hot as it will over power the fish) * Juice of 1 lime * Some thai fish sauce * Some finely ground black pepper * A banana leaf (or two small ones, or a pandan leaf, or tinfoil if all else fails) ***What you need to do:*** 1. Start heating up your grill, bbq, or oven 1. Take your banana leaves and soak them in warm water to soften them up a bit and make them a bit more pliable. 1. Peel a thumb sized piece of ginger and slice as thin as humanly possible 1. Peel three cloves of garlic and do the same 1. Take the lemongrass stalk, peel off the outer leaves slice the white part of the stalk, again as thin as you possibly can, do the same with the chilli (use as much or as little as you prefer) 1. Chop two of your spring onions and slice them on the diagonal (these don't need to be too finely sliced) 1. Put all of this in a pestle and mortar and give it a bit of a bash! We aren't trying to make a paste here but a bit of a bruising to release the flavours of the woody ingredients like lemongrass and ginger. 1. Combine (approx) 1tbsp Kecap Manis, 1tbsp light soy sauce, 1/4 tsp fine ground pepper, 1tsp fish sauce, juice of half the lime. Now check the balance! Is it too salty? Add some more lime juice. Is it too sour? Add some more Kecap manis. lacking salt? Add some fish sauce. Balance it out and get it right, trust your palate. (as an aside I tend to keep this one a *little* on the salty side, but that's just my taste.) 1. Once you're happy with the balance of the seasoning sauce, add your ingredients that you have sitting in the pestle and mortar. 1. Give it a mix. Doesn't it smell awesome? It smells like holidays! 1. Grab your fish, and a sharp knife. Slash the fish right down to bone in a few places, both sides of the fish. 1. Put it on a plate and get that delicious sauce all over it! In the slashes you made, in the cavity, on the skin, everywhere! Reserve a little bit of the solids from the sauce. 1. I'm going to have to be a little vague with wrapping instruction I'm afaid, as it depends on the size and shape of your leaves and your fish. Take your Banana leaf and lay it out flat. You are going to want a double layer of banana leaf if you are going to cook over fire or direct heat. Place the fish onto it and pour the remaining sauce over it. 1. Now you need to wrap it. Do it whatever way you can. Use soaked bamboo skewers or soaked twine to secure it all tight (I personally find skewers the best method, thread them through like you are sewing) 1. Lower the heat on your grill, you don't want to burn the leaf badly. It can stand up to some heat but not a high grill. 1. Place the package on the heat and leave it alone. If your bbq has hood, close it. 1. Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. Use your judgement. For a fish big enough to feed two people I reckon it takes about 15 mins over a medium low heat. I'll have to leave this step up to you. 1. While the fish is cooking take two spring onions and slice them paper thin on the diagonal, or cut into matchsticks, these are your garnish (or you could use some coriander leaves if you like it) 1. Presentation time: use a scissors to cut the parcel open *at the table*. OMFG when your guests get that smell bursting out when you open the parcel they are likely to foodgasm. Sprinkle in the chopped spring onions. I usually serve this just with small bowls of good basmati rice sitting on plates, and some stir fried asian greens (bok choi, kai lan, choi sum, whatever) and let people help themselves to fish. I prefer this method of serving, it's a bit more social. 1. Drink lots of ice cold beer. 1. Eat lemon or mango sorbet for dessert. 1. Have fun! I'm always open to comments and constructive criticism, so feel free to tell me what you think. I think this could be greatly improved if served with coconut rice. Has anybody got any tried and tested recipes for coconut rice?","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Just as an introduction to people who think they don't like tofu you should try Mapo Tofu...It's not exactly what you are asking for, but it fits in the same vein. It's one of my favorite dishes to make, and it's not only delicious but cheap and fast and a great gateway into what tofu can be. And yes there is meat... in it (there are also vegetarian/vegan adaptations but the dish isn't the same). But it's not really a meat dish, and it gives you that satisfying feeling you get from eating a bunch of meat, while only eating a little. I usually do 2 ounces of ground meat (pork is best, you want the fat) to 1 package of firm or extra firm silken tofu (silken is important!) . I've had the butcher ask why i want so little meat and even actually got him to try it himself. I eat way too much meat, most of us do. I wish I could eat less but it's satisfying, easy to cook, readily available (and never not ripe!), and really too cheap. (An aside, I sent my girlfriend to pick up some mushroom from safeway, and she got a package of 8 ounces, for 4 dollars, that's 8 dollars a pound for some fucking cremini mushrooms, there are so many meat options I can buy cheaper) But there are ways we can reduce our intake, and do better things for the planet, our taste buds, or even the animals (buying less of more expensive free range local meat from animals that had better lives than factory farmed meat). My real issue is just how hard it is to reduce my meat consumption at breakfast and lunch (I eat one or the other, along with dinner, so I usually am looking for something filling and satisfying). I can scramble up two eggs, throw a piece of ham with a slice of cheese in the toaster oven, throw two slices of bread in the toaster and have a really satisfying breakfast sandwich in around the same time it takes me to make a cup of coffee. I'm not into oatmeal or hot cereal (childhood trauma ;p), I do like granola, yogurt and fruit, but only if I can actually find ripe fruit. And it still isn't quite as satisfying. Anywhere I buy breakfast I can't remember the last time the vegetarian option appealed to me more than any of the normal ones. With lunch again, I can make a sandwich quickly, or buy one. I've tried some mozzerella tomato and basil sandwiches, but they are never good because the ingredients aren't fresh when you buy one, and you can't make one in the morning and not have it be soggy by lunchtime. When I go grab some tacos, kebab or a bahn mi again the veg options always seem more of an afterthought than anything. Or there just isn't the value on the menu, one deli where I used to live had a good eggplant sandwich, that cost just as much as a proscuitto brie and fig sandwich. Nothing against eggplant, but im taking the proscuitto brie and figs. As to straight up vegetarian, I'll do a coconut milk veggie curry with tofu (my curry paste probably has dried shrimp in it, but i know there are vegetarian alternatives). This chipotle miso tofu is also pretty damned good: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe.html These Chayote squash tacos are so good you dont even think about meat when you eat them with some beans rice and grilled corn: https://www.rickbayless.com/roast-chayote-make-tacos-declare-victory/ Roasted butternut squash, carrot, onion, and mushroom enchiladas: Yea, that shit sounds great even if you were looking to eat meat. So many restaurants have blah vegetarian options, but this is something (similar) to what I ordered at a place because it sounded better than their meat dishes: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html I usually don't like vegetarian pastas, or well, I don't like vegetarian pastas with supermarket produce. It's never ripe enough, the flavors just don't pop. But if you've got a local market that has local food sources, or a farmers market there are a bunch of great pasta dishes you can make. The first is just a simple fresh tomato sauce with basil and olive oil. Best with fresh pasta, actually ripe tomatoes (two things money can't buy, love and actual vine ripened tomatoes) and good olive oil. :https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/spaghetti-with-fresh-tomato-sauce-and-basil but you can go all sorts of directions, get some fresh broad/fava beans, or some garden peas (also can throw either in a risotto).

This is most notable in trendy pubs rather than there being heaps of restaurants selling solely American food, although those exist also. And it's not like they didn't have BBQ sauce or burgers here before. I'm just saying that at trendy places they now often have these types of foods and they're often marketed as \"Authentic American\" rather than being Aussie or some kind of fusion cuisine.

{"text":"It is! Because the bigger company will have to first import products to their warehouse, further process, export to the country of the supermarket, have it sit in the supermarket warehouse, link up systems for restocking, and restock. That's the basic distribution, and it's already far more expensive than ours. Because our company buys in the same quantity as those large multinationals, and we have our own manufacturing / processing facilities, our raw material cost is the same, and warehousing cost for the specialist range is near nil in the big picture. Other independent retailers are also probably the same. Individual shipping may eat up margins, but ultimately it ends up cheaper because the bigger retailers also pay licensing fees, agency fees for buying, and a few others - none of which apply to the small ones who sell online. You're right about the ethnic stores sometimes having questionable quality. In a city like New York the general quality should be ok for whole spices, because you have a large community of people who will consume them, so whoever the importer is has more buying power.

If you're a knife geek and have super sharp metal knives, you probably don't need a ceramic but I urge you to get one anyway (and keep it separate). Don't use it on bones, or on a glass cutting board, or any other obviously stupid thing. Instead, use it to cut sashimi-thin slices from a raw tongue, or to cut raw beef heart into cubes, or to cut beef cheeks into steaks, mincing herbs, or to cut soft vegetables into perfect slices. It's sharp but fragile, like a glass scalpel, and should be treated as such. That said, it's my go-to for casual cooking. You won't be sharpening it. You'll use it until you throw it away, then you'll buy another. If you're careful, it'll last for years before this happens. For crushing garlic, chopping carrots, cutting up a whole chicken, or chopping through a bone? You'll be using a heavy metal knife.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"You're going to want to do some Googling. Look up the Picayune Creole Cookbook, a good reference for Louisiana cooking. It's pretty old, so I believe it's available free online. Anyway, there are two broad styles of gumbo: Cajun and Creole. Both usually start with the trinity: onions, green peppers, celery. Many recipes start with a roux (equal parts flour and oil) cooked to some shade of brown, and then you add your trinity of aromatic vegetables, let it cook a bit, and then add some garlic. For a Cajun gumbo, you usually want the roux to go pretty dark, like chocolate. You also want the onions nicely caramelized. Some people do this in a separate pan; some just add them to the main pan, but before the rest of the aromatic vegetables. For a Creole gumbo, you don't brown things as much, and you usually add some tomatoes. Now, for the seasonings, you can add some store-bought Cajun or Creole seasoning, or you can just add stuff to taste if you have a well-stocked pantry. I like cayenne, paprika (preferably smoked), black pepper, oregano, thyme, bay, Worcestershire sauce. Then add some chicken stock and let it simmer, and add whatever meats you want. If you are using multiple meats, add them at the right time so they all get done cooking simultaneously. You can also brown meats in advance for additional depth of flavor. Some people say a gumbo must contain okra. If you want it, throw it in to simmer along with the meat. If not, you might want to add some fil\u00e9 powder. Do this right before serving, preferably on the plate; heating fil\u00e9 makes it stringy.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Best part is, no learning curve (considering I burn water). Never buy canned, go for frozen. The additives in cans would give my husband bad migraines. Frozen may be just slightly more expensive but better in the long run for your young family. Stress that your child has to eat at the table and eat what you serve.

{"text":"You have just discovered a really tasty part of poultry that many overlook or get turned off to. I love these things. First, always give them a real good wash/rinse. Secondly, due to the large amount of connective tissue in gizzards, I find they either need to be cooked at higher heats (roasting, grilled) or cooked longer and slower. Hearts not as much, but they can be very chewy if cooked poorly. Both are very flavorful, almost the essence of whatever poultry they belong to (chicken/turkey, etc) Here's how I cook and eat both: Try tossing in salt/pepper/garlic and baking in a ramekin or on a sheet. I prefer the ramekin option. Boiled (for 20 minutes) and chopped or shredded fine they make a really nice addition to the appropriate poultry gravy, or even in a nice mashed potato. Save the water you boil them in for stuffing moistener or for stock or soup later. Summertime, I like gizzards and hearts on a skewer, marinated in anything that strikes your fancy, I tend to like garlicky or peppery marinades for 24 hours. Eat them right off a stick. I've sliced the gizzards lengthwise and used them in stir-fry, or as long shreds in soup, ramen style!","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Light grill and regulate temperature to 250 degrees. Add cherry and pecan wood for smoking. Once the smoke turns from white to light blue and is not billowing white, it is ready for the chili. 2. In the meantime, chop celery and onion until you have 3 cups of each. Finely chop the jalapeno and the poblano peppers. 3. Using an enameled dutch oven, saute in 1 tbsp vegetable oil until translucent. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add to the mixture Saute this mixture for about a minute, then make a hole in the middle of the vegetables for the spices. This will give them some space to bloom. After spices have cooked in the oil for a few minutes, mix everything together and let cook for another minute. Add 1 cup of red wine and let this simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beef stock, beer, bloody mary mix, and pinto beans (optional). You can test for salt after this simmers for a few minutes. Bring this mixture to a slight boil, then let simmer. 4. Put the pot of chili on the grill indirect with an air gap under it. I rolled up 3 pieces of foil and set them under the pot so there was an air gap and it did not sit directly on the plate setter/heat deflector. This will prevent it from getting too hot and boiling over and the chili should have a slight simmer for the duration of the cook. 5. Prepare the ground beef by hand by rolling into an oval and dusting with salt and pepper. Place a rack over the chili, then the meat on top of the rack so it drips into the chili as it smokes. When the meat reaches 165 degrees internal temperature, the meat is ready to be broken up and added to the pot. Simmer for 20 more minutes and then serve hot with corn chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onion.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

It should be, once it's properly seasoned it will develop it's own nonstick pantina http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/features/wokcare.html First cook the chicken/meat get the wok hot then throw in a small amount of high heat oil such as safflower or grapeseed. Move the wok around to distibute the oil. Throw in a small amount of the meat slightly bigger than the flat part of the wok at most coated with s&amp;p no marinades. Let it sit for several minutes, do not stir. Flip it over and let it sit for sevral more minutes. Stirfry untill fully cooked. It is critical to use a small amount of meat cut in small pieces and to let it sear for several minutes. Gets nice browned char marks and avoids steaming. Use damp paper towles to absorb any moisture and cook the meat/chicken in batches. Next cook the vegies. Add more oil, add garlic, cook for a few minutes, then add chillis, wit a few more minutes then add whatever other vegtables you want, stirfry until done. If you are using a lot of vegies you may want to look into just cooking the garlic and chilis in the wok and steaming or blanching the other veggies. Or just cook them in small batches in the wok. Absorb the moisture with a towel, add the chicken until everything is hot. Then serve with sauce on the side. You could put the stirfry on a serving platter or even in a large tupperware container for easy cleanup and then add the sauce to the stirfry. Do not ever add sauce to the wok, it will remove part of the pantina. tldr Use seasoned carbon steel wok cook meat in small bathces sear meat for sevral minutes before stirfrying cook vegies seprately, also in small batches do not add sauce to wok","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Cook to temp, not to time. Follow the advice of the other commenter and buy an instant-read probe thermometer; we're talking six bucks. You just need to bring the meat up to 165\u00b0. I've always had great results with the Cook's Illustrated method of flipping the bird three times during cooking. Start it on its side, wing-side up, and after 20mins flip it to its other side, wing-side up. After another 20mins flip it onto its back, so it's breast-side up. I always baste it after each rotation. This sounds like a lot of work, but if you're chilling in the kitchen while you cook it really isn't. **edit:** use either a roasting rack, balls of aluminum foil, or side items like onions and potatoes to hold it in place. Onions and potatoes will roast with the pan drippings and be delicious. Another tip is to pre-moisten the breasts by loosening the skin and putting butter and lemon under it. Literally just stick your fingers under the raw skin and loosen it away from the meat; you'll have to tear a slight membrane and if it's your first time it might feel a little uncontrolled. That's ok. The skin isn't going to float off if you loosen it \"wrong\"; there isn't a wrong way to do it. Slice a stick of butter into, like, 1/8tbsp pieces (your stick of butter has a printed measuring stick on the wrapper, just cut the smallest increment, which is a tablespoon, in half) and slip them under the skin. Bonus points for slicing 1/2 of a fresh lemon into thin wheels and slipping them in with the butter; stick the rest of the un-sliced lemon up the chicken's cavity before you throw it in the oven. The breast is the first part of the chicken to dry out because it has the least fat, so you want to add liquid to it during cooking however you can. Cooking it with butter and/or citrus under the skin (limes and oranges work just as well) and basting it will do this. Alternatively, if you don't really care about the skin, boil it. Stick that sucker into cold water and bring it to boil in a stockpot. In about 25 minutes it'll be *done.* The skin will be useless mush so discard it, but the meat will be tender and perfect for use in just about any recipe.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"You are completely exaggerating. You need to cook it longer if you are using flour to get rid of the raw flavor and to let it thicken but that is quite easy to see while you are cooking. You certainly aren't going to end up with a \"mass of raw flour\". Not to mention, you are acting as if lots of people don't use flour as a thickening agent. Flour is pretty common and in my experience actually holds up better than cornstarch for food you are going to store in the fridge. The only real difference in terms of cooking is that you need to cook it longer. That's hardly a complicated procedure to follow. Once again, for the goals of an infograph saying flour = cornstarch is totally fine. It's a general idea and you can learn the specifics behind it by looking at another source. An infograph is not meant to stand on its own.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"> The results aren't going to differ all that much, if at all. I'm on your side here, but you are wrong. Many of us just know how to adjust a recipe so that it is perfect. I make bread, I always go light on the flour, and keep flouring the surface (working flour in) until I can feel that it's \"right\". But I did move to a scale for some recipes. One I had was from a german site, and it was in german, for banana chocolate brownies. And you know what - they were awesome, and a family favourite for years. But when I actually weighed the ingredients (after making it by volume for years), the recipe was still awesome, but quite different, more brownie-like, and less cake-like. So I think there is a lot of leeway for things to be different, and measuring versus weighing does make a difference, it's just that each way is probably acceptable (if not what the recipe maker intended)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker and pour the can of root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours (*8 hours for super tender*) or until pork shreds easily with a fork. - 2.

Most of these do not require any pre-cooking, but I can't vouch for how these all come out. I recommend using your judgement when it comes to seasoning. Also, based on my experience, skip anything that contains pork chops. They dry out super easy in a slow cooker. There are definitely some \"sheet pan\" meals out there that can be prepped in advance and frozen as well, like this one with pork tenderloin, asparagus and sweet potato. This chicken one is pretty good too. > The less knife work I need to do the better as well. Definitely ask your butcher to trim, cut, or otherwise prepare your meat in the manner you want it for your recipes. Also, there's no shame in relying on frozen veggies, which are usually cut to a good size for roasting on a sheet pan. I joke with my husband that every veggie I had until adulthood either came out of a can or a bag in the freezer, and we still use a lot of frozen vegetables today.

{"text":"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do 180 new recipes, but take it from this old home cook, I've spent my entire adult life in the kitchen, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only train one part of your palate (and that's all a single exercise like cooking is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for cholesterol down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine. Cooking basically only trains the stomach and to some extent, the small intestine. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major gastro groups (large intestine, liver, tastebuds) at the same time, over the course of a meal. And don't forget your dessert work! I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with food, eating a lot, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find a good restaurant, with qualified chefs who will design your meal for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for yummy tendies. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or being in shape the first time you walk into the restaurant. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and do it! :-)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"I was a line cook/sous chef for 14 years. I definitely developed some philosophical points about cooking; maybe not an outright philosophy. Basically, I realized that we do not cook and eat for one consistent reason, but for many, and that realizing this really removes a lot of the bullshit around cooking and eating: To sustain: this is why there is canned tomato sauce in the world. Sometimes, you just need to not die. For nostalgia: this is why you still use grandma's pizzelle recipe, even if it isn't the best. It's that specific taste. We eat like this to remember. To enjoy the taste: this is why you spend half your paycheck on one dinner at home for you and the Mrs. The foie, the saffron, the artisan cheese plate... this is the sensual type of cooking and eating. To enjoy the process: can I make a better brioche than the bakery 4 blocks from me? No. Does the pleasure I get from making the starter, waiting a day, incorporating the eggs and butter, watching it rise, and seeing it come out of the oven more than make up for the lack of overall quality? Hell yeah. I think we cook and eat for very different reasons all the time. The only important thing about cooking and eating is to be honest. Honest food is always good. For the restaurant cook, it depends on the restaurant. As an eater, I enjoy an honest $7 meal from a Dominican hot-table restaurant as much as I do a $250 tasting menu dinner from a New American restaurant. Just know where you are and what you're there for, whether it's at Le Gavroche or your living room couch.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

This is a fun one to share because it gets rid of leftovers and you can take one day whenever you run low and make a shit ton of these babies. 1. Get tortillas, I like to get multiple sizes, so, depending on how hungry the body attached to the hand grabbing it, it will be satisfied. 2. Get all your shit ready. I usually do this when we have a lot of leftovers that would freeze well, for instance, in this case, eggs, shredded cheese, corn, onions, frozen hashbrowns, pork al pastor, and rice with beans. And then I get crazy and buy a few more things shredded chicken for the enchilda sauce we bought on sale forever ago, roll of sausage on sale, some cheap ass bacon, refried beans. 3. I line up all the different goodies and mix and match, some get eggs and cheese, some beans and rice and eggs and bacon, whatever combinations I feel like until I run out of tortillas or ingredients. IMPORTANT: it is important to put something that will keep the burritos from drying out when cooking i.e. refriend beans, cheese (I put this on all of them for insurance), the chicken soaked in enchilada sauce. No one likes a dry buritto 4. Wrap all the little burritos and the big ass ones too in saran wrap, let cool a little if your ingredients went in hot (mine were not) and then stick em in the freezer. 5. You're hungry; burrito!

Let me explain: Per Person: *3 eggs * 3 small corn tortillas * half an avocado * a bit o' cilantro * Refried Beans (optional) * A bunch of chunky salsa Method: Take a large skillet or sauce pot and fill with enough salsa to cover the bottom. Turn on medium-high heat until the salsa is bubbling. Then use a ladle or wooden spoon to create 3-4 divots in the salsa chunks. In the meantime, cut up your avocado into slices and chop some cilantro. If you want refried beans, get them heating up too. CAREFULLY crack and pour an egg into each divot. Cover the pot with a lid and let them poach for 5-6 minutes or so. Watch them, you'll know when it's time to go when the white of the egg has just fully covered the yolk. If you want them less runny, since I know you don't like eggs, just let them go a minute or two longer. When ready, scoop refried beans onto each corn tortilla and place an egg on top. Top with some of the poaching salsa, avocado, and cilantro and enjoy! These get messy, so bring a napkin. Hope this helps!","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

It would be as convenient as the microwave but not as quick. But you just preheat the oven, wait, pop it in, and then do something else. I agree with someone else who suggested getting an extra big cutting board to go over the sink so you such extra space.

You'll still be able to rinse and stuff but you'll be able to utilize the space above the sink. I also recommend a slow cooker, which can do the cooking for you while you're at work. However, considering it's so small, I highly doubt the counters have actual stone. If you plan on using a toaster oven or slow cooker, it might get hot enough to damage the counter and be a fire hazard. If you shop for a slow cooker on Amazon, some of the reviewers mention that it scorched/melted laminate.

{"text":"Roasted Turkey, stuffings, veg casseroles(green beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts etc), salads of varying kinds, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie etc. Depending on where you live, large grocery stores often offer pre-ordered dinner sets. It might be worth checking it out, if you have never roasted a turkey before. It's a pretty simple and easy deal, but people find ways to mess up the roast. http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/nov/14/where-can-i-buy-a-ready-made-thanksgiving-meal/ http://blogs.sacbee.com/shop_cheap/2008/11/thanksgiving-dinners-and-weekl.html Most grocery store dinner packages can go as low as under 50 bucks. Now it will be cheaper to get the turkey, stuffings, gravy, casseroles/salads, mashed potatoes and rolls. But if you think about the time you have to spend prepping and cooking, it might be worth paying a little more for the labor. And you can make sure everything is cooked well enough. Also note, those packages are usually designed to feed more than 6 people. If not, you can just buy a couple of turkey breast rotisserie, and make the other fixings yourself. That's a great idea for the two of you and much cheaper. Usually they sell for 2 for 1 around thanksgiving day.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Imagine that carrot, celery, and parsley got together and had a 3-way-baby. It's hard to describe, but absolutely delicious.

{"text":"*1. Android app** http://www.pepperplate.com is amazing. It's free, the desktop version syncs with mobiles and tablets, and you can scale recipes up and down. It's also super easy to add recipes you find: on some sites they even import automatically at a single button click. Otherwise you cut and paste and it formats everything for you. **2. Out of date vegetables** Some vegetables last ages in the fridge, eg carrots. Salad greens don't do so well. Even if carrots get a bit withered they're still great for stews (after all, our ancestors stored vegetables all winters). I personally find frozen veg has an odd taste, but frozen sweetcorn is great. **3. Quick meals** Here are three super quick and easy meals that you can make from long-lasting pantry ingredients, including frozen chicken pieces: * Italian Pasta &amp; Bean Stew - lasts a week in the fridge. Ignore the bean-soaking stuff, I just use canned. Base recipe is a little bland, I would add paprika and chorizo (but some kids prefer bland so it's useful if that's the case). You can skip the spinach if you don't have any to hand, and you could get away without the celery if you needed as well (so just beans, onions, pasta, bacon). * Crockpot Peanut Chicken - the only slow cooker recipe I have found that has the perfect, thick sauce after cooking. Serve with anything you like, even just bread, and you can skip the fresh herbs. * Smokey beans - I'm not even going to link to a recipe as this one is so easy. Chop and soften-fry an onion. Add a can of tomatoes and a can of beans (any kind: chickpeas even, if you like. Cannellini are great). Add a couple of tablespoons of BBQ sauce. That's it. You can add whatever else you like to it: chopped up capsicum peppers, carrot, sweetcorn, chopped herbs, chopped sausage/chorizo, bacon. Whatever else you have spare. But the basic beans/onions/tomatos are fine, and great with crusty bread. **4. Storage** You can store nearly everything longer than it says. You can also freeze milk. Old/tired vegetables can be used for a stew, no one will notice (their nutritional value may be a bit degraded, but they won't be harmful). Store dried herbs and spices in the fridge if you can. If space is an issue, buy mixes. \"Moroccan spice\" blend instead of separate cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. \"Mixed herbs\" will go with everything from French to Italian, pasta, pizza, stews. Soy sauce is a great way to add a bit of flavour to things and lasts for ages.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"The purpose of brining, mainly, is to retain moisture in lean cuts of meat during high heat cooking. Pork shoulder is cooked low and slow and has plenty of fat to keep it moist and succulent. If you brine it, you will find it has a texture closer to ham, which is not what you're looking for with pulled pork. Brining will also prevent the bark from forming properly, which (for me) is the best part of pulled pork. To make the best pulled pork, use a rub all over the surface of the pork, then wrap it and refrigerate it overnight. Remove from the refrigerator about 40 min to an hour before cooking, regardless of method. Of course, smoking is optimal, but you can get excellent results in an oven.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

(or any ethnicity, i'm just using indian food as an example because i really want paneer tikka right now) basically, people can cook whatever they want. authenticity is stupid unless you're trying to pass something obviously not authentic (god i hate that word) as 'authentic,' like barbecue tikka masala ;X (gross!). as long as you're not being an obtuse asshole about it i think it's fine!!!","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"Don't use fresh tomatoes unless you get them from a reliable source, like a farmer's market you trust. Otherwise use canned, since canned tomatoes are picked ripe. Supermarket tomatoes tend to be picked and shipped green, then ripened via exposure to ethylene gas. They don't develop the flavors they would on the vine. If you do get fresh tomatoes, they take a very long cook time due to all the water. My mom grows her own and they are delicious, but she freezes hers before turning them into tomato sauce. It removes a very large percentage of the water without much effort or energy. You can even give them a squeeze at that point if you want them really dry for a dish. Regarding the blandness, you should add more umami ingredients. Mushrooms, worcestershire or other fish sauce, or even straight up MSG are good options. It's a salt as well, but a different type than NaCl. If you want a slightly sweeter sauce, you can add a finely grated carrot.

It's kind of a two for one deal with scallions, it's why I love to always have them on hand! They make such a fresh difference to any dish, but especially Asian ones. Fresh Chilies can also be used liberally, to saute and as garnish. I also am using Chinese cooking wine pretty liberally these days.

It keeps the mixture fluid, evenly distributes heat, and there is always time in the first few minutes to go to the pantry for more flour. A light roux must be done on the stove top, because color and more importantly, smell are crucial in deciding when to pull it. A darker roux, imo, is much easier. You can use an equal amount of butter and flour(or favor flour for an even darker roux) and move to the oven @~350, preferably convection. Even heat from all sides does wonders for a dark roux. The oven takes longer but offers a much greater margin of error with a darker roux. Once the roux is the right color, add your liquid until the viscocity feels right to you. Guard against adding to much liquid because if the mix thickens further in the cooking process, you can always add more liquid, but you can only take liquid out by standing in front of the stove, staring at a watched pot boiling.

Deboned, I like the kind with skin on one side * Salt * Pepper * Olive oil * Lemon juice (optional) **Recipe:** 1) At least 2 hours before cooking, earlier if possible, submerge the plank in water and let it soak (weigh it down with something so it's completely covered) 2) If using a charcoal grill, start the coals. If using gas, you can turn it on later. 3) Cover flesh side of salmon with a thin layer of olive oil, then salt and pepper to taste. You can add lemon juice here if desired, but I don't think it needs it. 4) Take plank out of the water, place salmon on the plank 5) Once the grill is hot, place the salmon (with plank) on the grill and close it. I use indirect heat, putting the charcoal on one side, and food on the other. 6) Cook for 8-15 minutes (cooking times vary greatly depending on your grill), until the fish is 120-130 F for medium rare.

Either way, if I'm using a lot of tomatoes in something, I rely on vinegar to offset the sweetness, and use plenty of aromatics (which OP is doing) to give the acidity some much needed subtlety.

{"text":"Hello fellow night shift worker. I know what you mean about being not being hungry for the first few hours after you wake up. From my experience its not really worth forcing yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but as far as your mood is concerned you're probably going to be a much happier person if you've eaten before you go to work. Porridge and toast can be bland, but they can also be exciting. For instance, try changing the bread you buy around, or more importantly, buying higher quality bread, as well as butter, and then buying a small selection of different jams. I enjoy Apricot Jam a little too much (I grew up on a stone fruit orchard), so I went and bought strawberry, orange and a mixed fruit jam to add to my collection. I stopped there because those jams will collectively last me a year. With porridge your best friend is fruit. I don't know how you serve your porridge currently but when I used to eat (I don't anymore) I added a small dollop of fresh cream and served it with diced fruit on top. Mint is also relatively neutral, so if you're a fan of mint adding a few leaves might also be worth a try (Spearemint would be my go to). Alternatively you could add muesli and yogurt to your diet, as well as cold meats, cheeses etc. Its starting to get cold here in Australia so what I've started to do is put the oven on, peel some potatoes, carrots, turnips, sweet potatoes etc and then just roast them in the oven. They take long enough that by the time they are ready I am hungry, and the beautiful aroma means I'm usually famished. Its also the kind of meal that requires enough effort for reward that it feels like its worth the while, and leaves you plenty of time to clean up while you wait. If you're a fan of ritual then I strongly recommend it.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"I do Marley Spoon (Australian version). Observations: **The good...** 1. It's wonderful to not have the mental hassle of choosing and planning, and the physical time of shopping, for every meal 2. It's a really great way to learn to cook and expand your cooking techniques and repertoire. (Much cheaper than cooking lessons, and easier and more structured than working your way through a cookbook). 3. You get far more variety for a lower price than you would do with supermarket shopping 4. It's more expensive than supermarket shopping: *unless* you're an impulse buyer/poor planner/lover of more gourmet foods. 5. In the latter case (more gourmet meals) I've had Marley Spoon meals before that cost less than buying at the supermarket. Eg one that came with four different fresh herbs: at a major Australian supermarket, these would be at least $10-12. 6. With Marley Spoon you get to choose each week's meals from a list of seven - OR you can just let them pre-select. This is great if there's a particular ingredient you don't like. With many recipe delivery services, you get what you're given, no choice. **The bad...** 1. Packaging waste. It's pretty awful. Supposedly the cardboard is recyclable, but every week comes with these silver cold bags with frozen gel/ice packs within. All this gets chucked out. (Sure you could re-use - but who needs more than one or two? You'll be getting half a dozen more each week). 2. Currently they make it very hard to switch between Couples and Family. You have to adjust your account settings, at a specific time each week so you don't reset your in-progress order. You can't mix it up either. It's a shame, because 2-person during the week, with one Family on weekends would be ideal.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

This also gives you much more control of the heat than in an oven. * Fire your pan up to mid-high (7/10), add 1 tbs of olive oil and let it get nice and hot. Then you turn the pan down to medium (5/10) before you add the salmon. * Us your hands, utensils can break your filet. When adding in the pan, make sure the fish \"lands\" pointing away from you. This way you don't get splashed by really fucking hot oil. * Watch it as it cooks. You can see the color changing from the bottom to the top. When it's tanned about 40%, you flip it. Again, just use your hands. This should be the only time in the cooking process you touch the fish in the pan. * Your salmon is done when its cooked 40% through on each side. About 1/5th of the filet size should be pink in the middle. Images for reference: Perfect vs overcooked. GL.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"I cook both ways. I have a health issue that screws up my sence of taste and smelling, some days. (headaches with auras and a pervision of smells. Ocassionally a fresh peach off the tree smells like rotten meat). My poor daughter has Zero sense of smell so her ability to taste is cockeyed too. So when we are sharing recipes we often use exact so things can always be duplicated. If I start adding spices from my imagination to a dish, I write it down exactly for Dear daughter. Thank good for a good cooking scale. My grand daughter is the offical taster and sniffer for our cooking marathons. I believe that recipes are a great place to start. If I offend someone with a too weird dish I just say Sorry and don't do that again. I totally believe that the sense of taste has a whole lot to do with genetics and your current life. Example. Science has proven that people that over use salt, often while they were in the womb, their mother had a lot of morning sickness/nausia. The mommy was often dehydrated from vomiting during the pregnancy. The developing baby is \"raised,\" so to speak in a high salt atmosphere. As a functioning human, they crave salty foods and often oversalt the foods they cook. Also our sense of taste has to do with the chemicals in our body. You have heard that certain meds will make your foods taste metalic or very blaw tasting. Each of us at the stove has to cook the way our family likes no matter what the recipe says. That is why there are about a million recipes for speggetti sauce, \"just like grandmas\". So one written recipe calls for a pinch of salt but the cook uses a tablespoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of sugar to get the flavor they want. Our medicines and the chemicals we put on our skin and use in our house, really make a difference in the way we taste/perceive a food.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Stir fry is cool because it can literally be as much veg as you want.

{"text":"Potato soup. You can dress it up or down, but it's delicious and hearty. Maybe not great if you're in the hemisphere moving into summer, but a good standby for the winter blahs. I start by sauteing garlic and onions in olive oil (or butter, or the grease left over from cooking up homemade bacon bits...just saying...) in a large stock pot. while cooking, I dice up a bunch of Yukon gold potatoes (or russet or Idaho or whatever floats your boat). After the onions and garlic are nice and soft, I add the potatoes into the pot with enough chicken stock to cover all the potatoes. I add salt and pepper. How much will differ with what kind of stock you use. Less is more in this instance as you can adjust later. I also add celery seed and rosemary and whatever other spices jump out at me from the cabinet. I boil the crap out of the potatoes until they're soft. Remove from heat. Then I add a little milk (or cream, or more chicken stock or butter or a combo of all or try something like yogurt or sour cream). I take my stick blender and whirr the whole thing until its relatively smooth. I like it a little chunky. If you need more liquid, add it now. Taste. Does it need salt? Add salt. Do you love cheese? Stir in some shredded cheese while it's still smoking hot. Serve with green onions, bacon bits, shredded cheese. If you have leftover steak, might I suggest a blue cheese and steak panini on the side? Or steak on a bed of salad greens with blue cheese crumbles? Delicious, fast, easy, and wonderful.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"*Pan Temperature** Frying is normally done in oil that measures between 350 and 375\u00b0 using an infrared thermometer. There are several methods that can be used to determine the proper temperature without using a thermometer. *Brown Butter Method* Put butter in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the butter will melt. When the pan reaches a temperature of 212\u00b0, the butter will start to bubble as the water in the butter starts to evaporate. As the temperature rises, sputtering increases and then stops. The milk solids in the butter begin to brown rapidly when the temperature reaches 250\u00b0. This is hot enough for low temperature frying, sweating onions, or making omelets. *Shimmering Oil Method* Put canola oil in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the oil will flow smoothly and quickly around the bottom of the pan. When the pan reaches a temperature of 275\u00b0, the surface of the oil begins to glisten and shimmer. When the oil is shimmering all over the pan, the temperature is 325 to 350\u00b0. Continue heating and a few wisps of smoke emerge when the temperature is around 375\u00b0. By the time the temperature reaches 400\u00b0, multiple wisps will be easily visible rising from the pan. *Chopstick Method (Chinese Stir-fry Test)* Place the handle of a wooden spoon or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles steadily, the oil is hot enough for frying. If the oil bubbles furiously, the oil is too hot and needs to cool off a little. If no or very few bubbles form, the oil is not hot enough. *Bread Cube Method (Joy Of Cooking)* Drop a half-inch cube of bread into the oil. If it takes 60 seconds to brown, the oil is at 365\u00b0. *Popcorn Method (Cooks Illustrated)* Drop a single kernel of popcorn into the oil as it is heating. The kernel will pop when the oil reaches between 350 and 360\u00b0 (Remove the kernel and start frying) *Leidenfrost Effect (Rouxbe Cooking School)* The Leidenfrost effect occurs when a dry pan heats up, at 374\u00b0 an eighth of a teaspoon of water will form immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan. As the temperature increases the water test shows: * The water pools and evaporates slowly (tepid) * The water boils quickly and evaporates rapidly (warm) * The water boils vigorously and evaporates very rapidly (warmer) * The water steams rather than boils and evaporates immediately (not hot enough) * The water pool breaks into multiple small balls that dance around the surface of the pan (almost there) * The water forms immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan (perfectly hot) * The water spurts immediately into multiple small balls that disperse quickly (too hot)","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"$430 a month on food is a nice budget for one person, including snacks and so forth - but you need to learn to work with leftovers. Either enjoying them as leftovers or learning to reuse them. Some of my standard meals during the course of a week include a whole roasted chicken (roasted chicken and veg the first night, then sandwiches for lunch, then maybe chicken tacos or chicken enchiladas the next night [with leftovers of that for the next lunch], then make stock from the carcass for using in other meals. I also do a lot of big pots of soup, stew, or chili that can be either eaten on for a couple of days or you can make double or triple batches of some things and then freeze them for later in the week or month (keeps me from getting tired of the same thing over and over). And I have to admit for a fondness for old-fashioned tuna noodle casserole (with homemade mushroom sauce) with frozen veggies in it. It also serves well for a couple of meals at a minimum and some leftovers you can freeze and nuke for later. Being willing to do a few veggie or low meat meals will help keep costs down as well. Make a pot of beans and rice or a veggie stir fry (or one with very little meat added). Breakfast for dinner can be cheap and really delicious, too. Speaking of breakfast, get away from cereal since it's expensive. I love steel cut oats in the winter - they're a little more expensive up front, but a 1/4 cup expands in a cup of water to make a nice serving, and when topped with cut up fruit, it's a good bit of food. Or mix oats with a little cheese and top with a fried or poached egg for a savory version. One thing I do that saves money is wait until chicken breasts go on sale for some ridiculously low price. Then I'll buy a bunch and poach them in water that has a big scoop of taco seasoning in it. Shred them and then freeze them in 2 serving packets. That chicken can be used in enchiladas, tacos, nachos, any type of Mexican dish you want, and it's pre-cooked and ready to go. Avoid prepackaged snacks and things that are in \"single serving\" sizes. They actually wind up costing more per serving. Obviously don't buy in bulk if you don't have a way to freeze/preserve things, but there's a balance between the two. I think on your budget you could have some great meals. Good luck.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"If you have the ability to grind your own meat, definitely go with that. If not, store bought ground meat with an 80:20 ratio of lean to fat is the way to go. Personally, I season my burger meat very lightly so it doesn't cover up the taste of the meat. As for making the burger itself, I normally mix 1 pound of meat with just salt and pepper and 1 slice of white bread that's been soaked in milk. Mix it only enough to make it evenly incorporated, that keeps the burger from being too dense. As for a barbecue sauce, here's my recipe for a Memphis style sauce 16oz Ketchup or other tomato product 12oz Cider Vinegar 2oz Brown Sugar 2tablespoons Onion Powder 2oz Worcestershire Sauce 2oz Dijon Mustard Mix all ingredients in a sauce pot and bring to a simmer.

{"text":"Lived in Thailand for 8 years. here's some stuff. * the eggs are fine. Most of them seem to be pasteurized, if you don't get a fridge the trick to storing them longer than a week seems to be rotating them so they don't stick to the inside of the shell. You can test the freshness of eggs with a glass or bowl of water. an egg is good if it sits on the bottom of the water or one end of it still touches the bottom. An egg is bad when it floats. * buy fresh local greens and keep them in water. cilantro (pak chii), morning glory (pak boong/pak bung), spring onion (don hom) all work well this way. Also, Thai garlic (the purple-husked kind you may be seeing at the markets) is particularly good for storing in the open, I recommend just keeping it in a basket so the open air doesn't promote mold. Same deal for chili pepper and so on. * * Also explore the available dry ingredients. Dry shrimp, squid, cuttlefish, etc Gung haeng, blameuk haeng, etc. There are also a variety of pickles- pak dong, gratiam dong, king dong, etc. * the water machines are safe enough. Depending on the region of Thailand, the big issue is generally over-chlorination. The water machines typically work by exposing the light to UV <which kills the microbes>. I lived there 8 years, and drank a great deal of tap water- I am still here to tell of it. * * Once you have a more permanent place, if that's your goal, ask your neighbors about the local water delivery truck and pay the 20 baht or whatever it costs for a big bottle per week. it's probably way more than you'll need. * Get a refrigerator. You can get one for ~$50 US. it doesn't have to be the western shower stall size, it just has to keep your food fresh and beer cold (don't drink Chang, even acha is better, Federbrau is probably the best quality Thai beer, get Beer Lao if you can).

{"text":"In school, I learned 3 basic types of battering. IRL(work), I apply them regularly, with varying functionality. First, the standard breeding procedure, or wet-dry-wet method. Alton Brown featured this method frequently, and stressed the all important \"wet hand\" and \"dry hand.\" This is traditionally Flour, egg wash (egg, milk), and your finishing coat (bread crumbs, flour, or cornmeal). This method will create a nice crunchy batter when fried. It is good for cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables. Second, the wet batter. This contains the famous Tempura style batter and Beer batter. Basically, mix flour with your wet ingredient. Dip what you want fried in the batter, and fry it. Usually, you will coat what your food in a starch of some kind before applying batter, but you do not always have to. Usually you see vegetables fried like this. Meat options I have seen are beer battered Cod and corn dogs Third is dusting or coating in the dry batter. This is used on seafood a lot. Fried oysters, calamari, shrimp. Also, anything \"lightly breaded\" is usually prepared this way. Basically, toss or coat your food in seasoned or plain flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, etc. and cook. Often, the fried item in question will either be wet from its own juice already (like shucked oysters in a tub are) or will be in a bath or sorts (like soaking catfish filets in seasoned buttermilk).

{"text":"How is it pronounced? Gar-sed, or garsd? Either way, it's not a word I know off the top of my head, but it's unlikely to be an Old English word since it most likely would have become \"yarsed\". Yorkshire is well within the Dane law, so it could be a viking word. I found \"g\u00e1rsecg\", pronounced \"gar-sedge\", which meant ocean, but again that g would have become a y sound. However, Old English was a very diverse language (especially in areas where the vikings settled) and we out have a fairly small amount of writing, which is far from representative of the language as a whole. It's possible that it was a word unique to that area of England, or that simply wasn't written down. Nor very satisfying but that's how it goes.

The chicken should be dark and sticky but not burnt, and the sauce should be thickened. Serve with steamed rice and a green vegetable such as broccoli or green beans.

However, it can be removed with Barkeeper's Friend (about $2 at any grocery store cleaning section or Home Depot) or just a bit of work with a steel wool. Or, you can just ignore it since it won't come off. I also tend to think that carbonized pans are a badge of honor, a sign of meals prepared, so it doesn't bother me at all. The only issue is that 10inch might be too small if you're cooking for a family. EDIT: after reading some replies on here, this will probably be one of the more expensive ways to go. I agree with perrycox - IKEA is pretty awesome. Aluminum - eh. AFAIK all hard-anodized (black) aluminum pans are nonstick, which is not what you're looking for. Bare aluminum is used by restaurants, and I've made cheese sauce in a bare aluminum pot before. The pros of it are that it's light, absurdly cheap, a top-notch conductor, and obviously tough enough for commercial duty. You treat it just like stainless steel. The cons are reports that it can interact with acidic food, although I wonder if the Aluminum Oxide coating (naturally forms in a microscopic, air-tight layer when truly bare aluminum is exposed to air) would protect the pan from acid. That would mean that you should avoid using metal utensils in an aluminum pan... but this is all guesswork. I've never used it at home. I would go ahead and not worry about the Alzheimer's thing simply because so many restaurants use them.

{"text":"Durability and weight mainly, a plastic board is much more susceptible to being knocked around simply due to being vastly lighter for one. Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"It is by far inferior in taste, texture, and nutrition. It's also ridiculously more expensive. (The cheapest way to buy rice is in bulk from Asian groceries; either Jasmine or Basmati is tastier than the American stuff, and a 20-lb. bag will often cost you no more than $10 and last you a year or more. Just keep it dry and bug-free and you're good.) Here is how you make basic, plain long-grain white rice of any variety (including jasmine or basmati) on a stovetop. Read the entire instructions before you start or I will not guarantee success. It's actually ridiculously simple, but there are various factors it's important to take into account. The easy version: put 1 part rice, 2 parts water into a pot, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, cook 15 minutes, remove from heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10 more minutes. That's all. The clueless person version: 1. Get out a pot that has a lid and will hold 50-100% more than the volume of rice and water you're putting into it. Otherwise your pot will overflow when the water boils. I recommend nonstick pots for rice, and ONLY for rice, because if you burn rice any other pan will be a writeoff. 2. Measure out the rice. A typical serving is between 1/4 cup and 1/3 cup per person. You're measuring by volume so what type of container you use makes no difference. *If you don't like your rice sticky, rinse the rice thoroughly before cooking it. You will be removing most of the remaining nutrition in the process, but that's your choice. *If you are making basmati rice, you can rinse and then soak it in cold water for 20-30 minutes and then drain before cooking. The grains will lengthen but otherwise the cooking process is the same. *If you expect each grain of rice to come out perfectly separate, you are a philistine and you can ignore these instructions and cook your rice like pasta in a big pot of boiling water, you prissy pantywaist. 3. Put your rice, whether dry or drained, into the pot. Using *the same measuring container*, add exactly twice as much water. Again, you are measuring volume. Volume is all that matters. 4. Place the pot on a burner and turn it up as high as it will go. PAY ATTENTION. Small quantities will boil very quickly. Give it a stir or two to prevent it all from sticking to the bottom of the pan. 5. As soon as the rice comes to a full, rolling boil (and NOT BEFORE), put the lid on the pot and turn the heat down very low. How low depends on your stove. If it heats really well, go straight to minimum. If it's a wimpy stove, go to the 2nd lowest setting. If you're using a gas stove, you may need to use a heat diffuser for optimal results. 6. Set a timer for 15 minutes. If you're using an electric stove, you may need to watch the rice for another minute or two, just to make sure it doesn't return to boiling; if it does, lift the lid until it stops boiling and then replace it. Once you're sure it's not going to boil over, walk away. Resist the urge to fuss. DO NOT remove the lid again until I say so. 7. When the timer goes off, remove the pot from the heat. Leave the lid on. Allow to stand for 10 more minutes. Congratulations, your rice is done. You may now remove the lid.

{"text":"Don't let everyone talk you out of starting from a fresh ham! If you wanna try something different without the difficulty of curing your own, then just brine one. My mom did this for Easter last year and it was delicious, and not at all difficult. It'll be different than what you get in stores, but still awesome - like a cross between regular ham and pork tenderloin. I don't have a guide, but I can tell you what she did (sort of). Start with a fresh ham, obviously. You should be able to get one from a local farm/farmer's market, or a decent butcher. If you want a prettier pattern and crispier skin, score it in a crosshatch pattern. Brine it in a salt/sugar/water mixture for about 24-36 hours. (If you want to turn this into more traditional curing, you can add nitrates and leave the ham in for much longer.) You can also include spices in the brine, depending on the flavor profile you're going for. When it's finished brining, bake it in a pan filled with water (keeps it moister) and prepare a glaze. The glaze is probably where you'd wanna work the Bud Light in. A traditional glaze has is usually sweet and spiced, with brown sugar, mustard, cloves, etc...I imagine you could work beer into that. Sorry for the vague directions but if you google \"brining a fresh ham\" you should get plenty of instructions and flavoring ideas!","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

This is merely based on the fat content of the beef, it has nothing to do with how safe or well treated the meat is. The reason for the grading is more fat means better tastes. All meat that is sold in USA has been inspected, but not necessarily graded. All this means the meat the OP is finding in his supermarket has an unknown quantity of fat marbling. It is however perfectly safe to eat. On this point, you can visually inspect the fat marbling in the meat to get a good cut of meat.

Generally speaking, you can easily mess around with the flavor of the baked good and be successful. Adding vanilla and almond extract to a white cake recipe, for example. Or if you're making a pumpkin loaf, you can tweak the spices, and/or brown the butter. Use grapefruit peel instead of lemon. Cut back on the sugar in a frosting recipe.

{"text":"K. The person with Type 2 diabetes, unless s/he is a complete n00b and was just diagnosed yesterday, has a mental list of foods to avoid and foods to choose, and if presented with a normal menu of \"meat, starch, 2 veg\", can usually pick and choose the healthful options. Where the problems lie is in a menu that is carb-heavy, such as cracker canapes AND mashed potatoes AND stuffing AND baked yams AND baked beans AND dinner rolls AND your choice of cake or pie for dessert. The person sometimes feels obligated, because it's a holiday, to eat some of everything. Or sometimes they just like to eat it, and so they cheat, especially if they're new at the diabetes thing. So a lot depends on how well you know this person, and how familiar you are with their self-control. Are they the sort to be unable to say \"no\" to some of their dining options? If so, then it's not a kindness to load up the buffet with all kinds of stuff they shouldn't eat; stick to the turkey, its stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, a couple of cooked veg, a green salad, dinner rolls, and in addition to whatever dessert you want, include something sugar-free for a dessert, but not fruit, since fruit still counts as carbs, so isn't always the \"healthy\" option for diabetics.

It's so intense that it's really only useful if you think \"this should make me sweat\"; but for that, it is awesome and tastes good to boot. * Smoked chipotle powder -- this adds heat, but it also adds a great level of smokiness. * Cinnamon -- this can add an oft-overlooked depth and taste to richer dishes. * Nutritional yeast -- this isn't really a \"spice\", but it's also not a \"food\" or a condiment or whatever. I like it because it has a lot of benefits, particularly for vegans, and it adds a great cheesy and nutty taste. It's great sprinkled in or baked on medium-light foods. * Smoked paprika -- it adds smoky flavor and, while not spicy, can add a little bit of heat. Plus it has great flavor. Medium-light foods IMO. * Dill weed -- it makes something taste almost lighter, if that makes sense. It's great for lighter dishes. I also discovered that there is a *world* of difference between pre-ground black pepper and freshly-ground black pepper. Like, seriously: get a pepper grinder. The difference is absolutely amazing.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"OMG, I just made this tonight! Eggplant's in season here so I got three huge ones for $3. Anyway, here's my favorite (spicy) way to make them: **Spiced Eggplant** 2 lbs baby or Japanese eggplant (if using regular eggplant, peel and remove most of the seeds) 2 tbl kosher salt 1 \u2013 2 onions sweet or red, roughly chopped 1/4 c ghee or butter 1 tsp whole mustard seeds 1 tsp whole cumin seeds \u00bd tsp turmeric 1/2 \u2013 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper 3 tbl tomato paste 2 tbl brown sugar 1 tbl white vinegar 1 tsp salt Cut eggplant into 1\u201d thick slices. Score sides in shallow crosshatches. Toss w 2 tbl salt and set in a colander to drain for 1 hour. Heat oven to 500. Rinse and dry eggplant. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or foil. In tall stockpot, melt ghee over med heat until liquid. Add mustard, cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper. Stir and fry until seeds pop \u2013 about 2 min. Add tomato paste, sugar, vinegar and 1 tsp salt. Stir and cook about 5 mins until mix turns brick red. Toss in eggplant and onion with spice mix, coat. Spread eggplant on rimmed baking sheet and cover with foil. Bake 15 minutes until tender. Uncover and bake until char spots appear \u2013 about 10 min longer.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

{"text":"> Any favorite recipes for compound butter? It's kinda whatever you're feeling or have around with regard to specific herbs. I'll usually have minced garlic, lemon zest, rosemary and/or thyme, parsley. Some salt and pepper. Maybe a touch of cayenne. > And I wonder if I'll be able to find 1.5-2\" steaks at the grocery store/Costco. I'd bet you'll be able to. Maybe not in the pre-packaged stuff but just go to the meat counter - I generally find pretty thick stuff there, or can ask the dude to cut something. > Where do you fall on grilling vs cast iron? I have a couple cast iron pans - maybe I could put one on the grill so it's still a pan seared steak and any smoke/splatter is outside. Eh, I go both ways with it. For a ribeye it actually might not be a bad idea doing the cast iron pan in the grill just to prevent flare ups and what not. But you can go either way. If I'm using my smoker as part of the reverse sear and I'm outside anyway I'll usually go with my grill to finish a steak. If I'm inside doing it SV I might just finish it on a pan on my stove.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}
