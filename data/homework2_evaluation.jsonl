{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients.

I have one, or both with every meal. Another thing I like to do camping is Kabobs! Cut all your meat (beef, chicken, pork or even add shrimp) and put in a zip lock with your favorite marinade. Then do the same with some vegetables in a separate bag. The good thing about this is that you can make kabobs anytime you get the munchies with little or no work. I break them out late-night for the stoner snack. Also grilled veggie kabobs for breakfast with my eggs.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}
{"text":"Which umami are we talking about here, the Americanized \"I can cook and saying umami makes me look smart\" umami, or the original Japanese umami? Because originally, umami was defined as a fifth taste, alongside bitter, sweet, salty, and sour. It was to round out flavours heavy with salt or bitterness. Sushi (the actual rice, not maki or nigiri) is the best example, as modern sushi is made to emulate the original dish, which was fermented rice and fish, and both a sour and umami flavour. At any rate, ingredients do indeed have an umami taste, unless you're talking about the bastardized \"umami\" that suburban middle-aged housewives have read about and then throw coffee into their pasta sauce and call it \"umami,\" in which case I have absolutely no interest in hearing anything about what you do or don't think umami is.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"}}

Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that. It should be said that generally, when making salsas as described in the above recipe, it's the fresh leaves that are added, rather than whole coriander seeds...
