My point was that if you're cooking quick and dirty, at home, bachelor style; microwaved chicken from frozen is damn good. I discovered it when I was trying to defrost it and ended up cooking it. Once I refined the process, I found the results easily comparable to anything done on the stove top, excepting for sear but we're talking about chicken here, and we're trying to not make a production out of the production, so searing isn't in context. If you're hell-bent on getting that crust, once it's cooked, get out the blow torch and put a sear on it. I've been in more than one restaurant that used this trick to get things looking nice... Anyways, have a nice day, next time your hungover and all the dishes are dirty, try microwaving some frozen chicken. If you wanna get fancy, throw some bacon and butter into the mix with some spice.

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":204160723,"_task_hash":-366237386,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710885008,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-alice","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-alice"}

{"text":"Given the state of research on diet, it's hard to say how much you should care about the recipe using butter vs olive oil, but either way, the quantity sounds excessive. Partly because congealed butter on top sounds unappetizing and wasteful. I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result. That said, this sounds like a holiday recipe, and it's best not to try to force holiday recipes to change.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-513829723,"_task_hash":-171573987,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710884644,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney"}

{"text":"In my opinion, unless your Vietnamese Grandma is gonna cook all day, the best way to eat pho is at a restaurant (hint: They all do takeout and its just as good, they serve all the components separately, and you make it yourself, get a large and its two meals). Making real pho broth takes many hours and many ingredients, its best done in large batches due to the cost and effort, but for a home cook, that sucks. Other than the broth, getting the noodles, veggies, meats/tendon/meatballs/tripe, and sauces is easy, but without the real broth its not quite the same However, one workaround... chicken pho! Just use low sodium chicken broth as your base, and put together your pho ingredients to your liking, and have it that way.

{"text":"I love cooking and have been doing it for twenty years. I've made some really good dishes over the years, and some not so good as well. My problem is that I could never quite reproduce the taste each time I made it without using a recipe. My wife would ask me to make a dish that was really good last time, and it would turn out different. Not bad, mind you, but not the same as she was expecting. Recently, I've been delving more into good blogs and online recipes, and I have to say I'm hitting it out of the park! I still occasionally make changes to dishes that I'm more familiar with, since I'm pretty comfortable working with different flavors and cooking methods. FYI, just because you follow a recipe doesn't mean you're not a good cook. You still have to understand and do things right. On the flip side, I've known many people (my mom in particular; don't tell her I said so) who could follow the exact same recipe and end up with something really bad. Some things that I've been making and getting rave reviews lately on are nearly foolproof however, especially using a slow cooker. I've been trying to find the most creative and delicious slow cooker ethnic meals that I can think of. I take the complements because I found the recipe, bought the ingredients, followed the directions and ended up with way better food for my family and friends than they would have made themselves. I've had people say they've never had that particular food outside of a restaurant, or that they didn't know you could make that in a Crock Pot. I've had some people say it's some of the best food they've ever had! Following recipes helps you discover all the culinary treasures, many that you'd miss if you just made up your own dishes all the time. Do yourself a favor and accept the compliment.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-724671400,"_task_hash":-920707719,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["NOT_RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710885129,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney"}

We've already seen some pretty good youtube clips on British gravies, CTM is very close. Pizzerias used to be run by Italian Americans who were very isolated and who guarded their recipes aggressively, but, eventually, that knowledge got leaked, and, now, we know just about everything there is to know about pizza. Indian restaurant food isn't that far behind. The biggest barrier, by a very very wide margin, is the common misconception that one of these seemingly countless recipes out there actually hits the mark. It's apathy that's holding us back.

{"text":"Congrats on your move! I think I've got a couple of tips :) Here's a video for 4 different ways to prepare your eggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIZNHQC01K4 And a ton of different egg recipes to spark your creativity: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/egg-recipes and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/best-egg-recipes/ As for having a college budget, I recommend making lots of frittatas or quiches. Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice. Get creative and have fun with it!

A friend of my wife's was staying with her mom at that point, and they had a couple extra bedrooms so they invited us to stay instead of trying to find a hotel. To repay the kindness, I offered to cook a nice dinner, figuring that they haven't had someone cook for them in quite a while and wanting to repay them for hosting us. Finding dishes and utensils wasn't so bad. However, I pulled out a hot dish of chicken parm from the oven, and unfortunately I picked an oven mitt that didn't have adequate protection. And the oven was more than a few steps from the table. And all the countertops were cold granite, no trivets in sight. The only way to not launch the hot af dish, or put it on a cold granite counter (likely shattering the dish and ruining the chicken due to thermal shock) was to grab it with my other bare hand. That burn sucked ass, because the reason I was in town was a music festival and I was there to perform. Fortunately most of the work on my instrument was with my right hand, and the burn was on my left.

{"text":"You know, every time I order out they never give me enough sauce so I end up making my own and I never regret it Mayo is a great base, and it's easy as fuck to make: 1Egg yolk' a little dollop of Dijon mustard, a squeeze of lemon juice in a mixer or blender. Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Pur\u00e9e and strain. Add tamarind paste and dark chocolate and cumin and cinnamon for a basic mole Grill tomatillos, peel, pur\u00e9e with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice and garlic for a salsa verde. Grill Anaheim or hatch chiles, peel and chop with garlic for a New Mexico style green chili Add fish sauce to any of the above chili sauces for a Thai inspired chili sauce Equal parts fish sauce and brown sugar, water for a Vietnamese dipping sauce Fish sauce, peanut butter and soy sauce for a peanut sauce Fish sauce, brown sugar water and onions will reduce and make a great glaze for grilled chicken Equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a touch of sesame oil for a Korean style dipping sauce Soy sauce and brown sugar makes teriyaki sauce Black bean hummus and fish sauce makes a really remarkable Korean inspired sauce for tofu Soy sauce mixed with tahini for a super great sesame glaze for chicken Soy sauce and lime juice is a great dipping sauce for fish or dumplings Rice vinegar and cucumber makes a great refreshing sauce for rice","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-263172663,"_task_hash":-862664355,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710886329,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney"}

{"text":"IMO, the key is browning. If you throw in the oven without browning, you're missing out on the potential chix flavor. Raw olive oil is healthy. Once cooked, as far as I understand it, it looses its positive properties and can actually be harmful - I've heard people claim this but I am having trouble finding any source. Perhaps a biologist or chemist can opine. Nevertheless, take any pan over high heat and let it get hot, but not so hot that it will scald olive oil in seconds. Also, preheat oven to 350, say. Season raw chicken directly. put in a tablespoon or so of OO and once shimmering, place chix in pan. Don't touch. Let brown. The chicken will release itself, even from a non-stick pan. Once it's cooked about 1/2 way through, just take the pan (assuming it's oven safe) and put the whole thing in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Don't undercook, but please... please... don't overcook the damn thing. Remove from oven and take out of pan. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve.

{"text":"My gf and I prepare a casserole or large dish every Sunday night, which serves as dinner and makes 3-4 lunches for both of us throughout the week. We also freeze some and rotate them, so we might eat the same one 2-3 times and take one from a previous week. We generally rotate around: * Lentil dahl or variation of some lentil dish. * Lasagna or some other pasta dish. Sometimes with meat, sometimes without. Rigatoni with italian sausage is one of my favs. * Mexican casserole with beans, corn, cheese., or some combo of tex-mex inspired food that does large portions like tons of fajitas (which freeze great), or a big enchilada casserole. * Big batch of stew or curry with lots of vegetables. Basically anything that doesn't take too long to make a big batch of, is healthy and is lunchable. Of course we'll make food with leftovers sometimes during the week, but I find it better to eat a salad or sandwich (which aren't great to keep overnight) at night and take my big meal at lunch. Furthermore, IMO, it's not really efficient to spend time cooking the night before if you're not planning on making a meal out of it. If you're gonna be in the kitchen, might as well eat, right? :) Extend that, and the best way to spend your kitchen time is to prep a lot of food in advance. If you really need a quick meal to prepare as a last minute thing to make a lunch, like the other commenters said, sandwiches are the quickest. But the feeling of popping out a beautiful, warm dish at lunch that keeps you filled for the next 4-5+ hours is more pleasant.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":2126465709,"_task_hash":1487898505,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710886527,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-sydney"}

{"text":"They're not hard to cook, they're hard to cook perfectly. EDIT: cooking at home and cooking in a restaurant are about as far apart as taking your car to the store and driving in an F1 race. That, and the contestants on Hell's Kitchen are not the most shining examples of skilled professionals. When they cook the dish, they've got a dozen other things not only to think about, but also to do. Not just that, but when the dish is fired, they've got to match it up with upwards of 4-5 other dishes going out. This creates problems and challenges. You have to communicate with other people who aren't extremely skilled at what they're doing, and rely on them to let you know how long it's taking them to complete their task. It's really not as simple as sticking it in the oven and taking it out when the timer beeps. It's more like - I've got 5 wellington on order, 4 fired, going with 3 lamb, just coming off my station. Now, I've also got to make sure that they finish exectly when 4 lobster, 6 scollop, and a vegetarian risotto. Oh, wait, in the middle of all of this, someone sent back a lamb I have to refire not because it was mistemped, but because it's a tv show and they scripted someone to send back food to test me on how I can adapt. And that isn't even a difficult rush for your normal everyday neighborhood bistro. So, while you may sit there and say to yourself, \"How difficult is that? I could do what they're doing.\" I assure you, the standard they're being asked to meet is one that far exceeds yours, and the sheer number of tasks they have to perform in the course of 20 minutes of a good rush in the kitchen exceeds the amount of tasks you perform in the average week in yours.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":1959247711,"_task_hash":-1688644142,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710886638,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-jake","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-jake"}

{"text":"Not really what you asked, but my main kitchen knife is a Chinese cleaver. It has a long, slightly curved edge that allows you to chop like a santoku, but allows for the rocking motion like a chef's knife. The wide blade allows me to smash and scoop anything I want with ease. It also allows me to \"sight\" my cuts- by looking down the spine of my blade toward the edge, I can align it so that I know I'm cutting perfectly downward. The wide blade is also good for using the \"claw grip\" because you can always rest your knuckles against it. With a less wide blade, sometimes your knuckles can slip above the spine of the knife if you are cutting something tall. I also feel like it's safer. It doesn't have a sharp point (it does have corners, though) so there's no stabbing hazard. If I need to poke something, I have my paring knife on hand. Plus, I just like the heft and balance of the cleaver.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1276894671,"_task_hash":623169149,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710886976,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-train-jake","_session_id":"hmwk2-train-jake"}

So the Chef/Sou/Fry/Saut\u00e9/Line cooks were showing me all sorts of stuff while I baked and prepared the salad dressings/sauces and breaded the coconut shrimps and stuff like that. That summer I also went home everyday and watched food network for like 4 hours straight haha. After that I just started looking up recipes and trying to replicate them. Now it\u2019s a mix of Pinterest, YouTube, asking friends,and just winging it. I buy my Asian ingredients at their respective grocer. I live in a major metro so they can be specific Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese instead of one place selling under the umbrella of Asia. Then we also have plenty of Mexican grocers and just a couple Indian ones and Russian. I\u2019m not a master chef or anything, but I do enjoy learning and cooking. My friends are normally impressed with my food, but it would never make it past a real chef.

For example: beef is traditionally served with a simple pan sauce or a horseradish cream sauce. Salmon and dill are a no brainer! ( try taking those traditional pairings and seasonings and using them in creative ways, like horseradish cream mashed potatoes with steak, or dill and bacon creamed corn with salmon) Pairing a meat with something that it often eats is also a great strategy.

Leaving them to soak in a sink is asking to get a chunk of finger lopped off when you go to reach in there for something. Dry them straightaway (mind your fingers!) and store them exclusively in that knife block or on a magnetic strip, but never bare in a drawer, as all that rattling will lead to dull banged-up knives as well. Get a decent-quality honing steel and give the knives a good few strokes every couple of days or so if you use them often. Don't use glass cutting boards as they're awful for a blade.

Without a thermometer, my best guess would be to bring 6 cups of water to a boil, dip out 3 1/2 cups and add 3 cups of bath warm hot water to it then add the egg whites (splitting the 212F of boiling with the 110ish F of hot bath water to be about 172F). Add about 3/4C of boiling water every 5 minutes to maintain the heat, but really just buy a thermometer if after one try you like the method.

Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder * 1 Cup Heavy Cream * 3 Cups Half and Half * 8 Egg Yolks * 9 Ounces Sugar * 2 Tsp Vanilla * 7 Ounces Milk Chocolate 1. In saucepan over medium heat, mix cocoa powder with 1 cup of half and half cream. Combine fully (no cocoa powder chunks!) and and the remaining half and half as well as the heavy cream. Bring to a simmer 2. Whisk the egg yolks until they are lighter in colour, then gradually add the sugar. 3. Slowly add 1/3 of the simmering cream mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly (this tempers the egg mixture). Once you've combined them thoroughly, pour this mix back into the saucepan on low heat. Whisk to combine. 4. Cook this mixture, stirring often, until it reaches 170\u00b0-175\u00b0 F. 5. Stir in vanilla and chocolate, then set aside until it reaches room temperature. (You should totally taste it now. This is a preview of the nirvana you will enjoy shortly.) 6. Refrigerate the mixture until it reaches 40\u00b0 F, then pop it in the kitchenaid ice cream maker and let it do it's thing. Make sure you turn the mixer on *before* you add the ice cream batter to it, or it won't churn as well. I like to shave some dark chocolate (or a white kit kat bar) and add it to the ice cream a minute or two before it comes out. When your kitchenaid starts clicking as it turns, your ice cream is pretty much done. Serve immediately if you ~~have no self control~~ like soft serve, or let it sit covered in the freezer for a few hours for a firmer texture. This ice cream is so silky smooth and rich - I hope you enjoy it! We also really like to add Bailey's, orange liqueur, chopped frozen berries, and toasted coconut flakes (not all together, of course - that would be madness!)

My family and I have always used the whole cracked pods, the little seeds are not bothersome, particularly when they are cooked and softened.
