{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709080109,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-alice","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-alice"}

{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709080361,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-kristen","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-kristen"}

{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709080146,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-jake","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-jake"}

{"text":"Home cook too. People like to eat what I cook (because of the flavour, not because they are happy enough that someone else is doing it). Two things helped me: - get out of your comfort zone. If you always cook for small parties (2 to 6 people), invite 10, to 20 people. This increases the pressure and ultimately you rise to the occasion. This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients. Gardening (even small scale on a balcony) teaches you a lot about ripeness, the \"real\" flavour and scent, the time of year when things are in season etc...

{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709080728,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-sydney"}

This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients. Gardening (even small scale on a balcony) teaches you a lot about ripeness, the \"real\" flavour and scent, the time of year when things are in season etc...

{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-1369956382,"_task_hash":-282035065,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["RELEVANT"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1709081544,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-eric","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-eric"}

{"text":"Charring is cool, just don't bother trying to take skins off; way too fiddly on a small, thin-fleshed pepper. When I make green salsa, I take half of everything except cilantro (chiles, tomatillos, onion, whatever) and roast that. Then I take half of the roasted, half of the raw &amp; blenderize it. The other halves I chop up. So 1/4 is roasted and processed smooth, 1/4 is roasted and chunky, 1/4 is raw and chunky, 1/4 is raw &amp; smooth. If that makes sense. Not saying it's the greatest, but people seem to like it. If you want a hot, flavorful pepper that you CAN scorch &amp; rub skin off, try a Manzano (spelling?) if you have a middle eastern store nearby; they seem to carry them. The ones I've gotten were hot as hell, but not sure if they are always like that. Very fleshy, about the size of a small slicing tomato, and thick-walled. First time I bought them, I started chopping thinking they must be mild &amp; got capsaicin all in my eyes &amp; face.

{"text":"Home cook too. People like to eat what I cook (because of the flavour, not because they are happy enough that someone else is doing it). Two things helped me: - get out of your comfort zone. If you always cook for small parties (2 to 6 people), invite 10, to 20 people. This increases the pressure and ultimately you rise to the occasion. This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients.

{"text":"Home cook too. People like to eat what I cook (because of the flavour, not because they are happy enough that someone else is doing it). Two things helped me: - get out of your comfort zone. If you always cook for small parties (2 to 6 people), invite 10, to 20 people. This increases the pressure and ultimately you rise to the occasion. This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients.

If you always cook for small parties (2 to 6 people), invite 10, to 20 people. This increases the pressure and ultimately you rise to the occasion. This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients.

{"text":"Charring is cool, just don't bother trying to take skins off; way too fiddly on a small, thin-fleshed pepper. When I make green salsa, I take half of everything except cilantro (chiles, tomatillos, onion, whatever) and roast that. Then I take half of the roasted, half of the raw &amp; blenderize it. The other halves I chop up. So 1/4 is roasted and processed smooth, 1/4 is roasted and chunky, 1/4 is raw and chunky, 1/4 is raw &amp; smooth. If that makes sense. Not saying it's the greatest, but people seem to like it. If you want a hot, flavorful pepper that you CAN scorch &amp; rub skin off, try a Manzano (spelling?) if you have a middle eastern store nearby; they seem to carry them.

I put a goddamned winking emoji and everything to indicate humor, but since you're coming at me with this know-it-all shit: Masa Harina is NOT just a brand name, is it the flour made by soaking corn flour in alkaline. Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that. It should be said that generally, when making salsas as described in the above recipe, it's the fresh leaves that are added, rather than whole coriander seeds...

It seems odd to use \"worth the effort\" for sous vide, because it's my go-to lazy way to prepare a meal and I use it for more than half my dinners. Maybe this is because most of my entrees (fish and game) are vacuum-sealed in individual portions already, but nothing's easier than dropping it in the water, then giving it a quick sear whenever I feel like making a side and eating.","meta":{"source":"homework2-DSBA6188-UNCC"},"_input_hash":-740611186,"_task_hash":1952822014,"options":[{"id":"RELEVANT","text":"RELEVANT"},{"id":"NOT_RELEVANT","text":"NOT_RELEVANT"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"single"},"accept":["RELEVANT"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1710281589,"_annotator_id":"hmwk2-eval-sydney","_session_id":"hmwk2-eval-sydney"}

I put a goddamned winking emoji and everything to indicate humor, but since you're coming at me with this know-it-all shit: Masa Harina is NOT just a brand name, is it the flour made by soaking corn flour in alkaline. Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that. It should be said that generally, when making salsas as described in the above recipe, it's the fresh leaves that are added, rather than whole coriander seeds...

When using butter, you need to remember that butter is only 80-85% fat, and make adjustments accordingly.

Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that.

Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that. It should be said that generally, when making salsas as described in the above recipe, it's the fresh leaves that are added, rather than whole coriander seeds...
